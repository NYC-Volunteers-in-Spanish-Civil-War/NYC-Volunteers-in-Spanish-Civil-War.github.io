        "data": "<p>The Jewish contribution to the International Brigade during the Spanish Civil War was often marginalized in the aftermath of the conflict. However, the Jewish people were among the first to volunteer to contain the spread of fascism. Thousands of Jews from 53 different nations, nearly 1,250 of them from the United States, risked their lives to travel to Spain to fight for the Republic. These Jewish volunteers originated from socialist and communist organizations, comprised nearly 10 percent of the volunteers, and were inspired by a &ldquo;strong sense of Jewish social justice.&rdquo; One such volunteer was Bernard Gerber, who offered his services to the Republican cause as an ambulance driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bernard Gerber was born on July 11, 1911, in Brooklyn, New York to working-class parents. He attended high school as teen, before entering the industrial workforce after graduation. Specifically, Gerber worked as a printer and later in a shoe factory located on 32-420th Street in midtown Manhattan. After entering the workforce, he joined the Workers Local of the United Shoe trade union. As an adult, Gerber became heavily involved in the labor struggle, and joined the Young Communist League in 1928, and the Communist Party of America in 1932. While in the league, Gerber received political training at the District and Section School of the YCL. He served as a daily worker agent within the party but held no official leadership position. Indoctrinated in the struggles of the communist party, Gerber led a strike against his shoe factory, leading to his arrest and imprisonment between 1934 and 1935.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the Spanish Civil War erupted, Gerber was determined to travel to Spain to aid his communist comrades in the struggle. He listed his address as 246/8 East 51st Brooklyn, New York and received his passport on May 25, 1937. He sailed aboard the MV <em>Georgic</em> on June 12, 1937, and arrived in Spain two weeks later. Once he arrived he registered for the Spanish Communist Party and trained with the Battalion of Instruction Tarazona in the city of Albacete to serve as a front-line infantryman. However, due to his technical skills, and before entering combat, Gerber was transferred into the Service Sanitaire, which was a front-line surgical unit. He became a trained mechanic, truck driver, and sterilizer, and served as an ambulance driver. Members of the International Brigades who had the skill to drive and maintain medical vehicles, such as Gerber, would work within the American Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy (AMBASD) as chauffeurs. Gerber picked up an ambulance on August 6, 1937, at Port Bou for the First Evac Group. He was commissioned at Villa Paz with other ambulance drivers, and it was at this time the Group of Evacuation became a formal military unit. This unit notably drove towards the Aragon front in an attempt to assist in the battle of Belchite at Quinto.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBernard Gerber continued to serve within the First Evacuation Group until late 1938 when it became clear that the Nationalist forces were poised for victory. Gerber returned to the United States on December 20, 1938, aboard the RMS <em>Ausonia</em>. He later moved to Deerfield Beach, Florida, dying in February 1979 at the age of 67.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Leo Solodkin was born on August 3rd, 1912 in New York City to Harry Solodkin, a shopkeeper, and Anna Solodkin. Prior to the war, Leo Solodkin studied Civil Engineering at City College of New York (CCNY) and was employed as a construction estimator. He was a part of FAECT, the Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists, and Technicians. FAECT was a union based in New York City that formed after splitting off from the International Federation of Technical Engineers, Architects and Draftsmen&#39;s Union for &#39;excessive radicalism&#39; while protesting low wages during the Great Depression. FAECT tried to have a presence in technical colleges across NYC in an attempt to give students exposure to the union and have them join once they had graduated. FAECT eventually affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). Many FAECT members were communists and FAECT was accused of having soviet spies. Solodkin was also a member of the Young Communists League which was rebranded as the Young Workers League of America to appeal to a wider audience. Solodkin participated in the Harlem Youth Club and American Student Union, the latter containing many communist members. He was also one of many other Jews who chose to fight in the Spanish Civil War.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLeo Solodkin sailed to Spain on May 8th, 1937 via the American Importer. By way of France, he arrived in Spain on June 1st of 1937. Solodkin wrote as his reason for joining the war &ldquo;The fight against fascism&rdquo; and that his father&rsquo;s communist ideologies influenced his own. From August 7th-17th, 1937 he was a part of the Lincoln-Washington Battalion. He then transferred to the XV Brigade Scouts until December of 1937. From December of 1937 to August of 1938 Solodkin served as a topographer in the 58th Battalion of the XV Brigade. As a topographer, or topographic engineer, his job was to turn reconnaissance from scouting missions into topographic maps. Solodkin served at Quinto, Belchite, Teruel, and Retreats and the Ebro Offensive. Belchite, a small town situated a few Kilometers away from the City of Zaragoza, was a two week long but intense battle resulting in near complete destruction of the town. The battle of Teruel lasted over two months during the winter of 1937-38. Casualties were extremely heavy on both sides and control of the city changed several times. The suffering of the Republican Soldiers was immense, as they were under-equipped and over exposed to the elements, during what was the coldest winter of the past two decades. On August 16th, 1938 Solodkin was wounded in his right arm during the battle of Sierra Pandols which was a part of the larger Battle for the Ebro River Valley and surrounding hills. The Ebro Offensive-the longest and largest battle of the Spanish Civil War-was the last battle for the International Brigades.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUpon leaving the Brigade in October of 1938 Solodkin was described as &ldquo;steady&rdquo;, &ldquo;willing&rdquo;, &ldquo;moral&rdquo;, and &ldquo;a good comrade&rdquo;. Solodkin returned home to New York City on December 20, 1938, aboard the Ausonia. He became an electrician and not many years later, after the start of America&#39;s involvement in World War Two, he served in the U.S. Army from 1942-1946. After WWII, Solodkin created a stationary store and newspaper delivery service with his brother. Prior to his death in 2001, Leo Solodkin had two children with his wife, Ada Solodkin, and four grandchildren.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Edward K. Barsky was born on June 6, 1895. He grew up in New York, with his parents and five other siblings, and in his youth attended Townsend Harris High School in Queens. Like his father and brothers, who were all doctors, he entered the medical practice. He attended the City College of New York, then the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. After graduating from the College of Physicians, he studied abroad in Europe--he visited Paris, Berlin, and Vienna. When he came back to the United States, he rose from being an intern, then visiting staff, then surgeon at Beth Israel Hospital, which his own father founded many years prior. He joined the Communist Party in 1935. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, Edward Barsky was an assistant surgeon, but he left his position to go help the cause. According to his passport, at the time he lived at 127 West South Street, NYC. He departed January 16, 1937, arriving in Spain in February. He was among the first doctors to travel to Spain to provide medical aid, departing only a few weeks after the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. During the War he helped to create the AMB (American Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy), and was a leading figure in directing staff and setting up hospitals. He was also head of the American Ambulance Unit. At one point, he and his staff were working 50 hours straight. He returned to the United States just once, but during this time he went on a speaking tour and raised &ldquo;hundreds of thousands of dollars&rdquo; and supplies for the cause. When he went back to Spain, he was named Surgeon General of International Sanitary Service, and was responsible for thousands of medical volunteers from all over the world. After the War, Barsky returned to Beth Israel Hospital. He married University of Wisconsin alum Vita Lauter, and together they had a daughter named Angela. He became the chairman of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, providing aid to Spanish Republican refugees who were suffering in the poor conditions of French refugee camps. While he was in office, the Committee raised nearly $400,000 within two years. He eventually found himself being investigated, and in June 1947 was convicted by the House of UnAmerican Activities for &ldquo;contempt of Congress&rdquo;, because the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee refused to turn in their financial records to the government. After three years of appeals, he was sentenced to six months in prison, serving time in the Federal Penitentiary (Petersburg, Virginia), and had to pay a fine of $500. He ended up serving five months. After serving, Barsky had his medical license suspended for six months--despite years of appeals--because, in the words of Judge William O. Douglas, &ldquo;When a doctor cannot save lives in America because he is opposed to Franco in Spain, it is time to call a halt and look critically at the neurosis that has possessed us.&rdquo; However, Barsky received support on an international level, many sending people even writing letters of sympathy-- &ldquo;Eddie is a saint,&rdquo; Ernest Hemingway once wrote to Milton Wolff, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where we put our saints in this country--in jail.&rdquo; Throughout the rest of his life, Edward Barsky remained committed and involved in progressive politics. He was involved in the New York Labor movement, and in the 1960s he served in the Medical Committee for Human Rights, which provided for the medical needs of the civil rights movement in the South. At the end of his life, Barsky was the consulting&nbsp; surgeon at Beth Israel Hospital. He died in University Hospital on February 11, 1975, at the age of 78. (An obituary was written about him in the NY Times that week.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Vincent Usera was born on December 8th, 1908 in Ponce, Puerto Rico. He arrived in the United States at the age of 1 with his mother, father, and sister on April 16th, 1910 in Manhattan. When he was 17 years old, he joined the US Marines and initially served in China&rsquo;s Yangtze River (along with other unnamed locations in the region) and in Nicaragua when the marines occupied the country to battle Augusto Sandino. In Nicaragua, he fought against the Sandinista ideology which was similar to communism but with some aspects of fascism, such as nationalism. His career came to an end when he was involved in an affair with the wife of someone with a higher rank than him and was kicked out of the military; after his departure, it became knows that he was sexually involved with the wives of other officers as well. Afterward, he lived in Rhode Island with his cousin where he worked as an insurance broker and became involved in show business: a 1934 Newport newspaper article stated that Usera was the house manager of a local theatre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He then moved back down to New York City to his address on 280 Riverside Drive so he could sign up to volunteer in the war, planning to re-enlist in the US military. Even though they were oblivious to this information, communist officials in New York City were skeptical of his interest in the war, considering that he had no affiliation with left-wing politics and was not known to be a politically opinionated person, so it was written in his notes to keep a close eye on him. However, they were still delighted to have someone with his level of expertise and combat experience on the side of the Republic. On March 29th, 1937, he received his passport to Spain and sailed to Spain on April 28th, 1937 where he eventually arrived a month later on May 30th, 1937.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he first arrived in Spain, it was noted that he would always be nervous and uncertain of his statements when it came to discussions centered around leftist ideology. As a result, it was a common theory that he was sent by the Army as an intelligence agent to keep a close eye on the left-wingers and their names; another theory was that he spied on the Brigades on his own accord to restore his reputation in the US military and regain their favor. To combat these, Usera boasted that he was friends with a well-known Washington labor activist&mdash;since this claim was made in Spain, there was no way to verify if his friend existed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He initially served in the Washington Brigade as a commander, but Steve Nelson was unhappy with his performance in the war&mdash;since he was known to disappear in the middle of major battles&mdash;and transferred him to a base in Tarazona where he became one of the most renowned infantry instructors. Steve Nelson was worried that he had been planted in the war and told Cecil Eby, a professor at the University of Michigan, that Usera always left his post without permission when help was needed; in his diary, Merriman wrote that Usera &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t pretend to be a brave man.&rdquo; However, he did prove useful as a trainer as he helped train the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, a battalion of Canadians. Before going to battle in Albacete, it was noted that Usera was &ldquo;placed in the hospital with venereal disease&rdquo; so he had to be held back in Tarazona until he was fit to serve. He served in Albacete and then disappeared to Barcelona where he was arrested and sent to Camp Lukas for trying to leave Spain without permission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, he moved up the ranks from a trainer to company commander to Oliver Law&rsquo;s second-in-command. At the battle of Brunete, he disappeared and wasn&rsquo;t heard of by any member of the battalion. Conveniently, this was before Law&rsquo;s death in the battle. The next record of him was in Antwerp, Belgium on May 25th, 1938 where he boarded the S.S. Black Hawk to New York where he arrived on June 5th, 1938. He then vanished temporarily until 1939 where he gave a lecture titled &ldquo;Some Lessons from the Spanish War&rdquo; at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland where he covered tactics, weapons, training, and defense measures. He then resumed his military career: in 1943, he was a major; in 1944, an executive officer of a European infantry battalion; then he became involved in military intelligence&mdash;he worked under Dwight D. Eisenhower, a NATO commander. He retired in 1963 at the age of 54 as a full colonel with a Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster and left the country to live in Franco&rsquo;s Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Jos&eacute; Luis Herrera Sotolongo was born in 1909, according to the US Census. Whether this is accurate or not remains to be seen: to this day, there remain multiple discrepancies between records, some stating that by the time of his enlistment in 1937, he was twenty-eight years old, but others stating he was thirty-five. While his exact date of birth remains unknown, he was born in Cuba and immigrated to the US in 1929. Within a few years of immigrating to the US, Sotolongo became an active political participant of the Cuban immigrant community, becoming a member of the Julio A. Mella Club alongside his career as a painter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Julio A. Mella Club was created by Cuban activists and political exiles in 1931 who had left their country in opposition to Cuba&rsquo;s dictator, Gerado Machado y Morales. Otherwise known as the &ldquo;anti-Machado struggle&rdquo;, the Club found support among Harlem&rsquo;s Cuban community, marked for its anti-fascist beliefs and organizing. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, many members of the Mella Club, who had been personally affected by the anti-Machado struggle would comprise one of the many groups of American volunteers who ended up serving in the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sotolongo, alongside many other Cuban peers, was recruited for the Centuria Antonio Guiteras (named for Cuban politician Antonio Guiteras), intended to be a Cuban unit to serve in the war. The US Communist Party paid to equip and transport each group of volunteers. The journey to Spain was long and difficult: the first group of volunteers left on the <em>Champlain</em> on January 5, 1937, where they landed in Le Havre, a town in France. They then took a boat train to Paris, another train to Perpignan, which was on the French border and after a bus ride to cross the Pyrenees, they would take another train to Albacete, Barcelona. While it is not explicitly stated, Sotolongo was most likely to be in this first group of volunteers, as according to his record, he arrived in Spain on February 10th, 1937.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After training with the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, the Centuria Guiteras was integrated into the battalion as Section 3, Company 1. Sotolongo himself would continue to serve with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade at Jarama, Brunete, and Aragon. By his comrades and officers, he was referred to as a &ldquo;good [Cuban] comrade&rdquo; but &ldquo;bad physically&rdquo;, a &ldquo;hard worker&rdquo;, and one that came with a &ldquo;good recommendation from the Brigade&rdquo; with a good &ldquo;political outlook. Thanks to his efforts, Sotolongo would eventually reach the rank of Commandant during his service, although this was short-lived, as not long afterwards, he would be injured at Aragon. After getting wounded, he would wait in Tarazona, a town in Aragon, for a little over a year, before being repatriated back to Albacete in January 1938.&nbsp; After receiving treatment, he would then return to the US on May 27th, 1938 on the <em>SS Cuba</em> to Key West, Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This would not mark the end of Sotolongo&rsquo;s dedication to anti-fascism. In fact, he would go on to serve in WWII, like many other Cuban veterans, choosing to embody his beliefs and values to the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Initially while doing research, I stumbled across another Jos&eacute; L. Herrera Sotolongo who, during the war, notably served as a surgeon for the Spanish Republican Army and was writer Ernest Hemmingway&rsquo;s personal doctor. I initially thought they were the same person, the more I read about Hemmingway&rsquo;s Sotolongo, I realized the details of his life didn&rsquo;t match up with this Sotolongo. They both served in different battalions, performed different duties, were born in different countries (Hemmingway&rsquo;s being born in Madrid, while this Sotolongo was born in Cuba), and Hemmingway&#39;s Sotolongo stayed in Spain a lot longer (he wasn&#39;t injured and didn&#39;t receive repatriation). Side note, but the eerie thing is that when comparing their photographs, the two look very similar!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Wilfred &ldquo;Mendy&rdquo; Mendelson was born on August 17th, 1915 in Brooklyn, New York. He was born to two lifelong socialists. His father was a member of the Polish Jewish Workers Socialist Bund and his mother was a member of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union.&nbsp; As a young child, he was taught about socialism, even proclaiming a hunger strike for the Irish socialist Terence MacSwiney at the age of five. Mendelson lived near Bronx Park, until his parents participated in a strike against the landlords and moved into the Amalgamated Cooperative Houses. There, Wilfred attended DeWitt Clinton and graduated in June 1931. He entered the City College of New York in the fall of 1931. Mendelson was heavily involved in political activism. He was a member of the Young Communist League, the independent Student newspaper, and the National Student League. When the principal of CCNY, Freddie Robinson, invited Italian fascists, Mendelson helped organized anti-fascist protests and was met with disciplinary action from the school. Mendelson was arrested many times at strikes and protests. Mendelson organized countless strikes and helped win union working conditions for the workers of cafeterias, Nathan&rsquo;s restaurants, and farmers. Unfortunately, Mendelson was expelled from college, and he never finished. After college, he became more heavily involved with the Communist Party, becoming the Acting-Organizational Secretary for the Communist Party of the 2nd Assembly District&mdash;his home neighborhood. After college, Mendelson was heavily invested in educating himself about communism, and when Franco&rsquo;s generals attacked Spain, it was Mendelson&rsquo;s natural cause to join the fight for the Republic. Mendelson had been deliberating on joining the war for a long time, but he was finally pushed to join the war effort after hearing Spanish veterans speak at the New York Hippodrome. He made the final decision on December 9th, 1937. After heavily studying the situation in Spain and dealing with passport and recruitment issues, Wilfred &ldquo;Mendy&rdquo; Mendelson left for Spain on the United States Liner S.S. Manhattan on May 18th, 1938. He arrived in Spain on May 29th, 1938. Mendelson came with about five other American volunteers to the Republican camp at Marsa. When he arrived, he was put into a training program. Mendelson had a tenuous grasp on Spanish, but nonetheless he helped teach the other volunteers. He also had an opportunity to stay in the rear, but he chose to fight on the front. After completing his basic training, Mendelson joined the Lincoln-Washington Battalion of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade on June 30th, 1938. The Brigade&rsquo;s objective at this point of the war was to redirect Franco&rsquo;s forces away from Valencia. On July 25, 1938, the Army of the Ebro crossed the River, and the Abraham Lincoln Brigade went with the second wave of Republican troops. The Army of the Ebro managed to capture 500 square miles of land and successfully locked down Francoist troops for four months. As the Brigade landed on the shore of Asco, Mendelson was outside the small town of Villalba de los Arcos, and this is where Wilfred suffered a fatal injury. Mendelson was sent back across the Ebro on a stretcher to the base hospital, but he died before cross the river back. He was buried in Asco, on the side of a railroad bridge next to the river. He died on July 29th, 1938, exactly two months after arriving in Spain.</p>\r\n",

Early on Newman developed a passionate love of baseball, the Brooklyn Dodgers in particular, and the English language. He wrote plays, poems, and novels all his life and was a gifted storyteller. Newman earned a Bachelor&rsquo;s and Master&rsquo;s degree from Southern Connecticut State College. It was this experience - getting an education surrounded by like-minded socialists and Marxists - that influenced his move back to New York to work as a Taxi Driver and help run the local Transport Workers Union and American Federation of Labor offices. At the same time, Newman had also become a card-carrying member of the Communist Party of the USA where he worked in the agitation and propaganda unit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After hearing news of the Spanish coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat by nationalist forces from friends and co-workers, Newman resolved to go to Spain and sailed aboard the French Line ship SS Ile de France to France on February 20th, 1937. In France, Newman spent a week in Paris pretending to be a tourist, before trekking over the French-Spanish border into Spain, so that he could enlist with the 1st Regiment de Tren, 2nd Squadron. This specific squadron was a unit of truck drivers, transporting Spanish and International fighters to the front.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In letters back home, Newman described his time in Spain as a mixture of relaxation and heavy, fatiguing work. Newman recalls his first week staying in an ex Duke&rsquo;s former villa in Catalonia. There Newman and his fellow squad members threw lavish parties. Right after however, Newman described driving for 50 hours straight in preparation for the battle of Brunete. Newman spent the war transporting troops to and from Brunete, as well as Aragon and Madrid. It was at Brunete where Newman was pictured with some of his squad members and the famous poet and writer Langston Hughes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When not driving or fighting, Newman spent his free time editing a paper for the members of his unit and also wrote poems and stories for various newspapers throughout the US. Newman even got one of his stories, titled Smudge on a Chinese Rug, published in Esquire Magazine while still fighting in Spain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newman went back home in October of 1938 aboard the SS Paris for his father&rsquo;s funeral and proceeded to stay in the United States. He got his old job as a taxi organizer for the Transport Workers Union in New York, and it was here, at a taxi strike in the Spring of 1940, that Newman met his future wife Edie. Once they got married the Newmans moved to New Haven, where Sol got a job working at the Yale University Press, and the New Haven Courier. It was here that Newman was investigated by the US Government for ties to Communism, and actively protested the Mccarthy trials, as well as the arrests of Ethel and Julian Rosenberg. Sol continued to be an ardent supporter of the Lincoln Brigade and its veterans, and a passionate socialist, who was even investigated by the government for his ties to the CPUSA. After a long life in New Haven, Sol and his wife Edie moved to the Meriter Retirement Home in Madison, Wisconsin, where he died on March 9th, 1999, at the age of 90. He is survived by three children, three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren, and even asked that donations be made in his name to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>&quot;A soldier who is politically conscious that he is right and who has a feeling of community with his society...will do his job well&quot; -Bill Aalto<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWilliam Oliver Aalto (preferred to be called Bill) was born in the Bronx on July 30th, 1915. His mother, Elsa Johanna Akkola, was a militant member of the Finnish Communist Party who fled to the United States due to her political beliefs and enrolled in the local communist party. Bright and well-educated from a once prominent landowning family, Elsa had immigrated to New York. Throughout her hard years of domestic service as a single mother in the stratified social hierarchy of America, she retained her staunch beliefs, gravitating towards local communist groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn 1927, Elsa married fellow Finnish immigrant Otto Aalto, the latter becoming the stepfather of 12-year old Bill. While he went through school, Bill took after his mother&#39;s social conscience; running with the Harlem Proletarians (a Finnish youth club) and joining the Bronx Young Communist League. Searching for his moment to make a difference in the world, Bill was struck by a personal tragedy- the death of his half-brother, Henry. In 1935, Bill, aged 18, left home and school, working as a truck driver before deciding to go to Spain and join the International Brigades(IB).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBill (aged 21) arrived in Spain in February 1937, a son of immigrants determined to make his mark upon an unforgiving world. At the time, Soviet military advisors in Spain were putting together their own guerrilla units within the IBs due to a lack of Spanish manpower. Being 6&#39;2 and having studied Spanish before, Bill was immediately recruited as a guerrilla soldier at Albacete, fighting in the Republican irregular forces. He repeatedly volunteered for dangerous operations, often spending weeks behind enemy lines. &quot;I became a guerrilla and stalked,&quot; said Bill in a 1942 interview, &quot;saw no bayonets, met very little machine gun fire, cut the barbed wire.&quot; Trained by Soviet instructors in the use of pressure-sensitive explosives, Bill, along with fellow comrades-in-arms Alex Kunstlich and Irving Goff, Bill worked with a detachment of Spanish guerrillas destroying railroad tracks, bridges, and power lines in preparation of the Republican offensive that began the Battle of Teruel. Their objective to destroy the main supply bridge over the Albarracin River may have been the inspiration for Ernest Hemingway&#39;s novel For Whom the Bell Tolls (though Bill himself was not present during that operation). By late 1937, both Spanish and International irregular forces were brought together as the Fourteenth Corps of the Republican army.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAs the battle for Teruel raged onward with no end in sight, guerrilla operations on the Southern front were greatly amplified. Alex Kunstlich came to command his own unit, with Bill as his second in command. Bill was responsible for all the logistics, supply, and strategic planning of Kunstlich&#39;s operations, in addition to driving the truck taking groups to their rendezvous points. The vast majority of their work remained that of demolitions - as very few guerrilla groups had the supplies to engage in partisan operations. This reflected the Republic&#39;s military weakness as a whole: so crippled by non-intervention it could barely equip its own troops - let alone distribute arms to the peasantry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nDuring the great retreats of 1938, Kunstlich was captured and executed near Granada. Nationalist armies had charged through Aragon to the sea, splitting the Republic in two. To restore morale in the face of this catastrophe, authorities planned a daring action in which both Bill and Irving Goff would undertake. On May 20th, Bill, now a lieutenant, alongside Goff, led a team of 25 guerrillas in a successful amphibious raid at Carchuna, Motril on the Southern coast of Spain, rescuing 300 Republican prisoners. They reportedly cut communication lines, killed the prison guards, and armed the prisoners with hand grenades. &quot;We weren&#39;t a raiding party,&quot; Goff boasted, &quot;We were a battalion&quot;. While the prisoners raced towards Republican lines, the rear guard, consisting of Goff, Bill, and two Spaniards, leaped from the cliff into the Mediterranean. Though both Spaniards drowned, Goff and Aalto used the cover of darkness to reach the shore at the edge of the cliffside, under the enemy camp. Trapped by the presence of enemy scouts, they reportedly huddled in the shallow waters for 48 hours, starving, thirsty, cold, and exhausted. In desperation, they swam to a nearby cave and rested for a day. Finally, they moved to a farmhouse, where they received the hospitality of Spanish peasants before returning to their base. This was the only commando raid ever undertaken in Spanish history.<br />\r\nIn June 1938, Bill was promoted to captain after 17 months of service, later spending three long periods hospitalized with fever, colitis, and chronic malaria. With the war essentially lost, Bill repeatedly wrote to his superiors that they&#39;d all be better off returning to the states and supporting the Republic on the publicity front. He was also concerned his passport might expire - he was still financially responsible towards his mother and half-brother John. It was November when he arrived in a demobilization unit in Valencia, January 1939 when he arrived in Barcelona, and February when he sailed to New York. He had been in Spain for nearly two years.<br />\r\nThough Bill came out of the war with the highest commendations, he did not tell his war stories. He was torn between the justice of the cause and the inhumane violence war demanded. &quot;The war is breaking us,&quot; he wrote, &quot;but also remaking us&quot;. Nevertheless he remained an active member of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB), speaking on behalf of the Republican cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOn January 20, 1939, Bill&#39;s stepfather, Otto Aalto, who had recently separated from his mother, denounced Bill to the FBI, reporting that as a partisan leader of the returning Lincolns, his stepson constituted a danger to the United States. As the Lincolns were already under FBI scrutiny, Bill was recommended for custodial detention. The detention was canceled a few months later when Bill volunteered for the army, as the authorities had decided military service was an alternative mode of surveillance for the Lincoln vets. However, Bill found himself assigned only to most menial tasks. &quot;I&#39;m on the FBI shit list,&quot; he said to a fellow Lincoln, &quot;or else the army&#39;s blacklist&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn 1941, Bill&#39;s former comrade-in-arms, Irving Goff, recommended him for recruitment to the Office of Strategic Services - a force that could utilize the Lincolns&#39; guerrilla experience in conjunction with resistance movements in the partisan war within Europe. However, he was not able to join.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nShortly after returning from Spain, Bill had confided his homosexuality to Goff, who revealed it to the other Lincolns, many of which felt Bill&#39;s sexual orientation could be pose risk to them all. It made them an easy target - not for the clutches of the FBI, but rather for slander by the public and within the army. At the collective request of the veterans&#39;, Bill was transferred to a training camp in Maryland in 1942, where he trained officer recruits in sabotage and demolition. In September 1943, Bill saw an officer drop a live hand grenade and lunged for it. Before he could throw it away, the grenade exploded, blowing off his right hand and part of his forearm. Bill was invalided out of service with a disability pension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nWith the help of his pension and the G.I. Bill, he returned to further his education, studying poetry at Columbia University. At this time, he published several pieces of his writings in the New Masses. After the OSS incident, Bill drifted away from contact with the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBill later traveled to Europe, where he met the poet W.H. Auden. Though sharing the company of other poets, Bill wrote little and gravitated towards alcoholism, frequently entering violent periods. Toward the end of his life, he became the lover of poet James Schuyler&#39;s, and features in Schuyler&#39;s poem, Dining Out with Doug and Frank.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Milton Young was born in the Bronx, New York. Once he completed his schooling at Penn State University, and returned to New York in search of a job. Despite his qualifications and good education, Milton&#39;s search for a private job was fruitless, so he took a job in the WPA Teachers Union in New York City.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilton had begun feeling strongly about the protection of security and workers&rsquo; rights. As he participated in strikes and picket lines, he became frustrated with the capitalist system. Once the United States Congress voted to prohibit citizens from selling arms to the democratically elected Republic in Spain, Milton, as a member of the Youth Communist League, left to fight for the Republic. He was one of the thousand Jewish Americans that joined the International Brigades in the fight against Fascism.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnfortunately, there is little information about Milton during the war. His name is not listed on the Scope of Soviet Activities list, so it is likely he used false travel documents under a different name to arrive in Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn June, 1937, Milton was placed in charge of the Runners. The George Washington Battalion was reserved at Morata de Tajuna after fighting from the line at Jarama. On June 30th, the Battalion left to join the 15th Brigade at Brunete.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrior to the start of the offensive at Brunete, the previous Commander Hourihan was transferred and replaced as Acting commander of the Lincoln Brigade by Oliver Law.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt 2:00 A.M on July 6th, the Licoln Brigade left its camp by the Aulencia River until it overlooked the Guadarrama plain over a ridge at 5:30 A.M. It was to act as reserve as the British Battalion launched the first offensive, attempting to cut off the retreat of Nationalist forces. However, this operation failed, as the British Battalion drew heavy fire. The Americans were sent in to relieve the pressure. Due to high casualties, and scorching heat, the offensive was put on halt until the next day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOvernight, the 13th Brigade and the Spanish Assault regiment carried out an airplane bombardment of the town. On July 7th, the Lincoln Brigade made advancements to the Guadarrama River. However, by July 9th, the Fascists were able to set up mosquito nests and trenches along Mosquito Ridge, causing the deaths of countless soldiers and officers, including Commander Oliver Law.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was in the beginning of the Battle of Brunete that Milton died, just a few months after arriving in Spain. The date of Milton Young&rsquo;s death is disputed; most sources claim he either died on July 7th or 10th. Because Milton was shot by a Fascist machine gun, it is likely he died on July 10th on Mosquito Ridge.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Hannah &ldquo;Honey&rdquo; Hershkowitz was born on January 10, 1912, in the Bronx to a Jewish family. Her address was listed as 1184 Cornwell Ave. From New York City, she sailed to Spain on the Normandie (April 14, 1937) and arrived on May 10 alongside the American Medical Bureau to serve as a nurse. She was posted throughout Spain, in Belalcazar, Vich, and Cordoba. During her time on the Cordoba front, she suffered from an unspecified mental illness but was barred from returning home by Dr. Barsky (a top surgeon). Friends recall her peculiar behavior; she kept an extra washcloth for the &ldquo;possible&rdquo; and excessively washed her undergarments as an excuse to hang them to dry: an open invitation to get shot by a Nationalist. The strenuous circumstances (sweltering weather and poor conditions) likely exacerbated Hershkowitz&rsquo;s mental illness. It is unknown why she sailed to Spain at all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHershkowitz&rsquo;s biography is brief, as she did not desire to live to tell it. After returning to the States on June 14, 1938 on the Aquitania (just past a year in Spain), Hershkowitz attempted suicide multiple times. She strangled herself at Beth Israel Medical Center, as well as attempted to drown herself. A man who loved her, Morris Kornblum, assisted Hershkowitz&rsquo;s mother with her hospital care. Kornblum (later changing his name to Martin Balter) served in Spain too, as a lab technician and field medic. His admiration did not ultimately deter her from ending her own life. She killed herself on August 1st, six weeks back home, dying at 27. (A separate record in &ldquo;Medicine in Republican Exile&rdquo; by Francisco Guerra, however, states that she was instead repatriated at the end of the war and simply &ldquo;died&rdquo; in 1968.) Hershkowitz was not survived by a partner nor children.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Albino Zattoni (1912-1983) was born June 4th 1912 in the small town of Tres in Trentino, an Italian speaking province which was controlled by the Austro-Hungarian Empire until it&#39;s annexation by Italy in 1919. He was probably born to a working class family. His father was David Zattoni, an electrician. Albino Zattoni&rsquo;s left-wing politics and socialist values were likely instilled in him from a young age, as his father was involved with the Socialist Party of Italy. The years of his youth were a time of conflict and political upheaval in Italy as socialists and communists fought in the streets of Italian cities and towns against Mussolini&rsquo;s fascist blackshirts. In 1922, Mussolini came to power in Italy and by 1926 the Socialist Party was banned. Mussolini&rsquo;s assassinations and persecution of Italian socialists which Zattoni and his father would have experienced must have contributed to his strong anti-fascist convictions. In 1929 Zattoni made arrangements to immigrate to the United States, either searching for economic opportunity or political freedom. He arrived in New York City in 1929 at the age of 17 to begin his new life in America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zattoni arrived in New York on the tail end of a wave of massive Italian migration to the US, fueled by Italy&rsquo;s severe rural poverty. He was taken in as a boarder by the Pozza family, a family of two Italian immigrants and their four children who all had crossed the Atlantic to America in the preceding years. He lived for this time on 249 Irving Avenue in Brooklyn, and learned English. Zattoni soon became tied up again in leftist politics. He joined the Socialist Party of the United States and became an organizer for the party . In a short time, he worked his way up to becoming a leader of a local section in the Socialist Party&rsquo;s Italian Federation (the Italian American division of the party), showing once more his commitment to working class politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1936, the Spanish Civil War broke out. Zattoni presumably supported the Republic from the beginning thanks to his anti-fascist beliefs, but he was a late arriver to actually join the International Brigades. He made the decision to travel to Spain only after the brigades had been organized and the stories of international and American heroics at Madrid and Jarama had been publicized. Having been inspired to action, he got his passport on April 3rd, 1937 and set off for Spain on May 12, intending to travel to France and cross the Spanish border. However, both the US government and France adhered to non-intervention, and sought to stop volunteers from joining the Republicans. Zattoni was arrested by French authorities in May and spent a month in a French jail. On his release, he set off right away for Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zattoni arrived in Spain via Massanet on June 14th, 1937. Despite coming from the United States he chose to sign up with the XII brigade, more specifically with the Garibaldi Battalion of volunteers from Italy, along with around 100 other Italian Americans. This might reflect that he continued to identify more as Italian even after moving to America. Italian volunteers like Zattoni were in a tough position because Mussolini&rsquo;s fascist government sent tens of thousands of soldiers to Spain to fight on the nationalist side. This left Italian volunteers fighting on the opposite side to thousands of their people, while their actions made them criminals in their native country. Zattoni himself was wanted criminally by the Italian police.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zattoni arrived with the XII brigade just in time to join in their retreat from Brunete. Following this the XII brigade, as part of the 45th division, participated in the Republic&rsquo;s Zaragoza offensive, the same battle as the XV brigade&rsquo;s failed attack on Fuentes del Ebro. The offensive made some progress but failed its objectives with heavy losses for the Republicans, and the 45th was stopped just 6 km from Zaragoza. At some point, Zattoni learned Spanish as part of his time serving with the Republic. In early 1938, Zattoni&rsquo;s division was moved briefly to Extremadura, before being rushed back to Aragon to stop the Nationalist breakthrough in the crushing Aragon offensive. The Republicans suffered a great defeat, but members of the International Brigade managed to hold the Nationalists back for some time at Caspe. Zattoni fought hard at Caspe and was decorated for his service there. Despite their losses, the XII brigade (and the other brigades of the 45th) managed to rearm to participate in the massive Ebro offensive in summer 1938, during which the Republicans launched their biggest attack yet against the Nationalists. The men of the Garibaldi brigade and the rest of the 45th saw their heaviest fighting of the war, but the offensive ended in complete disaster and the destruction of the Republican army as an effective fighting force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On September 21, 1938, the International Brigades were disbanded. Zattoni and the other volunteers began shipping home. He had fought hard for his beliefs and for Spanish socialism, but as he began the return journey to New York City on December 20th aboard the Ausonia, it was already clear that the Republic was on the brink of defeat. Still, most volunteers could see that the war in Spain was just the first contest in what would become a worldwide struggle against fascism. Like so many other International Brigade volunteers, Zattoni would soon return to war. He enlisted in the US army on February 22nd, 1944 to fight the fascists again. It&#39;s not clear where he fought, but survived the war and returned to New York again by 1945/46. After his fight in WWII, Zattoni slips from the historical records. It can be assumed that he became prosperous enough to enter the middle class. He made enough money to move to Lindenhurst in Long Island, where he lived until his death in April 1983. When he died, Albino Zattoni was 71 years old and he had devoted his entire youth to the socialist cause, for which he fought in Italy, the United States, Spain, and the battlefields of WWII.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Boleslav Wawrzykowski was born on April 17, 1916, in Brooklyn, New York, to Polish parents. It isn&rsquo;t known whether his parents themselves were immigrants from Poland, but this seems plausible, given the year of his birth, as two of the 20 million southern and eastern European immigrants who arrived in the United States between 1880 and 1920. Wawrzykowski completed just one year of high school before dropping out, and at some point during his younger years moved to Poland, where he lived until 1933. He returned to Brooklyn, where he lived on Wythe Avenue in Williamsburg and worked as a radio mechanic, a trade he may have learned in Poland or after leaving high school.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three years later, when the nationalist military forces in Spain staged a coup d&rsquo;etat, Wawrzykowski found a different calling. He was an anti-fascist, and the possibility of fascist rule in another European country was untenable. So, Wawrzykowski, through the Communist party, found himself aboard the <em>Aquitania </em>on June 2, 1937, sailing for Setcases, Spain. Twenty days later, the ship arrived at a port in Catalonia, and Wawrzykowski stepped ashore as an anti-fascist volunteer in the 15th International Brigade, which contained volunteers from the United States, Britain, Spain, and parts of eastern Europe, which suited the trilingual Wawrzykowski well (he spoke, English, Polish, and Russian).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was a member of the Washington Battalion, and first saw action with them at the Battle of Brunete, in July of 1937, a piece in the larger struggle for control of Madrid. Brunete was a town located on the outskirts of Madrid, and the Republican forces attacked it in an attempt to relieve some of the pressure of the Nationalist assault. While initially successful, the Republicans eventually were forced to retreat due to the devastating casualties inflicted upon them. The Washington Battalion alone lost close to half of its volunteers, and was later merged with the Lincoln Battalion, as the deaths were too difficult to quickly replace.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wawrzykowski continued to fight with the new combined battalion, nearly dying at Fuentes de Ebro when a plane exploded in front of his trench, until November 25, 1938, when he returned home aboard the <em>Manhattan</em>. He lived at a couple addresses in the city, staying in Manhattan upon his return, before moving back to Brooklyn, where he shared an address with a friend named Sam Jagan. Wawrzykowski worked at the American Holding Umbrella Company for a man named Charles Laden until Jun 5, 1941, when he enlisted in the US Army to fight in World War II. Curiously, military documents identify him as single, but he claimed in one letter to have a &ldquo;Spanish wife.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Staff Sergeant Wawrzykowski (though he described himself as a &ldquo;Radio Sergeant&rdquo;) initially was stationed in Hawaii, though by July of 1944 he had come back stateside, at that point being stationed at Camp Howze, in Texas. Wawrzykowski remained committed to the Lincoln Brigade, though, writing numerous letters while serving to other former volunteers requesting issues of <em>Volunteer for Liberty</em>, a newspaper run by other volunteers, as well as records from the war. Wawrzykowski also wrote that he felt discriminated against as an anti-fascist and thought that he&rsquo;d been turned down promotions for his beliefs. In one letter, he wondered openly whether he was fighting on the side of fascism or anti-fascism.

        "data": "<p>Daniel Alvin Pasternack (spelled Pasternak on some records) was born on July 20, 1914. Daniel was born to two Jewish polish-born immigrants, Joseph and Barbara Pasternak, who had immigrated to America sometime in the late 19th or early 20th century: some immigration documents show a certain Joseph Pasternak immigrating to the U.S.A. in 1883, although it is unclear whether he was the same man as Daniel&rsquo;s father.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In the 19th century, Poland as a state did not exist, instead the land was partitioned among multiple Eastern and Central European powers. Judging by the information provided in Joseph&rsquo;s immigration documents, he was likely from the Eastern part of Poland, the region under Russian jurisdiction. This would not have boded well for Joseph and his family, given their Jewish heritage. Among other things, Jews in Poland had to worry about <em>pogroms</em>, slavic riots aimed at Jewish villages, as well as state-induced poverty. Jews were expected to produce young men for the military, pay double the taxes of their slavic neighbours, and were barred from owning land or participating in certain industries, such as brewing. These factors contributed greatly to the decision of Daniel&rsquo;s parents, as well as many other Jews residing in Poland, to immigrate to the U.S. through Ellis Island.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Despite economic hardship and rampant anti-semitism in America, especially during the early 20th century, Daniel was able to gain access to a higher education. This may be due to the fact that his father Joseph himself was educated, or at the very least literate, as indicated on his immigration documents. A U.S. census shows him residing in Suffolk, Brookhaven at 16 years old meaning that in all likelihood he was attending the only high school in Brookhaven at the time: Bellport High School. After high school he studied at Columbia University in New York City. While there is no record of what he studied, there is a record that he went on to be a Mechanical Engineer.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Whether he was radicalized at school, or more likely in university, by 1935 he was a member of the Young Communist League, a youth organization focused on educating future communists and contributing to the working class struggle. It also seems that in 1935 he may have been a member of the Communist Party. The American Communist Party, founded in 1919, saw rapid growth in the 1930&rsquo;s as a reaction to fascist movements in Europe, as well as unemployment due to the great depression. In America the party mainly focused on popularizing unions and helping them negotiate against inhumane employers; however, it also held globalist views and closely followed the rise of fascism in Europe. Eventually, the Communist Party would send thousands of Americans to fight Franco in Spain, Daniel among them.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>On June 5, 1937 Daniel received his first passport, which just one week later he would use to travel outside the country for the first time. Interestingly enough, he listed his secondary addresses in Tampa, Florida. How and why a first generation Polish-American Jewish mechanical engineer held a second address in Florida is a mystery, but given that his primary address was 215 East 18th street, right next to Gramercy Park, it is entirely possible he was relatively well off by his mid 20&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>On June 12, 1937, just seven days after receiving his passport, he set sail on the <em>Georgic, </em>a brand new motorship which regularly traveled between New York, London, Southampton, and Le Havre (a port in Northern France). In 1940, the <em>Georgic</em> too would go on to fight the fascists, only in World War 2, as a troopship. After setting foot on land once again somewhere in North-Western Europe, Daniel proceeded south and crossed the Spanish-French border somewhere around Setcases, a mountainous region on the northeastern side of Spain, not far from Barcelona.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>After Daniel joined the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, an international battalion fighting under the XV Brigade, aka the Lincoln Brigade, his trail went dark. Aside from a brief photoshoot of his brigade, where Daniel appears in two of the pictures, no records are kept of Daniel&rsquo;s time at the front. Even the pictures are misdated, claiming they were taken 6 months after his death.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Daniel resurfaces once again at the Fuentes de Ebro, arguably among the most disastrous battles for the republic throughout the whole war. On October 13th (or, according to one source, 16th), Daniel Pasternack died to aircraft strafing, a common tactic in which a low-flying aircraft is mounted with an automatic weapon which fires at stationary targets. Because Franco&rsquo;s air force was&nbsp; largely supplemented by German aircrafts and pilots, it is likely that Daniel was among the first Americans to be killed by the Luftwaffe, which would go on to battle the British Royal Airforce in the sky. Daniel Pasternack lived a short life defined by one decision and the four months that followed it. This one decision, and the sacrifice that followed, transformed him from an average, if somewhat successful man, to a hero worth remembering and commemorating.</p>\r\n    ",

The school is known for its Victorian style design and has several famous alumni. After graduating, Gordon worked for Sulphite &amp; Paper Mill Workers as a union organizer. Louis then moved on to attend the Labor Relations School of Cornell University, where he was exposed to the circumstances of Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLouis Gordon joined the fight in Spain through The Communist Internationals, the communist parties of several nations, which recruited people to fight in Spain. The Communist Internationals would interview the recruits and have a physical check-up done on them to make sure they were fighting for their cause. While Louis himself was not a communist, he felt that many of his interests did align with the Communist Party, such as trade union activity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo get to Spain, the volunteers had to walk over the Pyrenees mountains to avoid troops who were put on the route necessary to cross it by the League of Nations. They were led by a Spanish smuggler who helped them travel through the Pyrenees to Spain. The smuggler forced the volunteers to climb the mountains that looked &ldquo;impossible&rdquo;, as Gordon called it because they never had any troops on them. They did suffer a few casualties on the harsh trip.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter that trip, Gordon went to Cordoba, serving as the truck driver for several other volunteers, who he would not see again for six months. He fought at Cordoba six months later, where Francisco Franco tried to cut off Valencia from Madrid, which would give him complete control of the southern half of Spain. After this battle, they had to cross the Ebro river which proved to be a difficult task.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGordon next fought in Teruel, where Gordon and the volunteers fought and drove Franco&rsquo;s army out. The battle was one of the bloodier battles of the Spanish Civil War. Gordon tried to help take men who were wounded from the battle to any areas nearby that would treat them nearby, but they were denied treatment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGordon then also fought in the Battle of the Ebro, which was the largest battle of the Spanish Civil War, in order to take Franco&rsquo;s armies by surprise. He suffered a wound to his eye during this battle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter Gordon returned from Spain, Gordon was drafted for World War II, where he was involved with anti-aircraft warfare. He also served as a sergeant with the Combat Engineers of the seventh army. He was among the first troops that freed the Dachau concentration camp in April 1945.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the war, Gordon continued his work with unions until retiring in 1985. He wrote in the union&rsquo;s newspaper for thirty-three years. When he retired, he became the director of the Paperworkers Retiree program. Then, in 1998, he became a consultant of the union health and welfare fund.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn his final years, Gordon advocated for the Ulster County Consumer Fraud Bureau, which awarded him the Pride of Ulster County Award for his community service. Lous Gordon died on March 25, 2006, at 91 years old.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Helen Freeman Feinberg was a nurse in the Spanish Civil War. She was born on March 19, 1914, in New York of Jewish descent. She trained as a nurse in Brooklyn Jewish Hospital. When she was 22 years old, a few months into her career, she decided to join the Medical Bureau in Aid Spanish Democracy. She was not a member of any political party during this time, but she went as she felt that democracy was being challenged against people. She arrived in Spain on January 16, 1937, and returned on June 6, 1938.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Spain, she worked as a frontline nurse. She was present in the battles of Jarama, Belchite, and Gandesa. She was one of approximately 50 American nurses. In an interview, she mentioned that she would not be able to sleep without her silk pajamas and would always carry water and soap in her bag. Like many U.S. nurses, Freeman introduced professional nursing practice for those who were not qualified in Spain; she was successful in helping the wounded even with the lack of resources. Freeman was fierceless in battle, even amongst explosions and ambulance chaos.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March of 1938, there was a bombing at a hospital in Hijar. Freeman sustained massive injuries; it was reported that she suffered a skull fracture and an upper arm injury due to enemy shrapnels. Due to the injury, she was not allowed to become a nurse for World War II later in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After she was dispensed, she instead served in helping clinics in areas of Peru and Ecuador. During World War II, Freeman worked with displaced people in Germany and later worked with migrant farmworkers in Oregon and Idaho. She also joined the American Joint Distribution Committee and continued to work as a nurse in New York City and California.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with all of her dedication, she was mislabeled as a communist and was continuously questioned by the FBI during the 1950s. The main reason for the skepticism was due to her time in Spain and her progressive point of view. Despite this, she continued to show her support for her fellow nurses in Spain and attend events such as the 53rd Anniversary Dinner for Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the 1970s to her death, she lived in Orange County, California, working as a school nurse. She died due to cancer on February 22, 1999, only a month before her 85th birthday. She has a son and a daughter and two grandsons. The Whittier Elementary School in California named a facility the Costa Mesa Feinberg Hall in honor of Freeman and her husband, Charles Feinberg.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

During 1922, he lived abroad in Spain and France, which, in addition to his identity as a person of Jewish descent, might have served as his motivation to volunteer in Spain. He traveled to many places before he went to volunteer for the Spanish Civil War. His travel records indicated he traveled from Antwerp, Belgium to New York with his wife, Alice Sinnott, on the SS Zeeland in August, 1925. He also traveled from Cherbourg, France to New York on the SS Lapland in October-November 1928. Another travel record indicates that he traveled from San Jose, Puerto Rico to New York in September 1931. On March 12, 1937, he was issued a passport, #374461, which he used to travel to Spain to volunteer. During the Spanish Civil War, he served as an aide to Major Allan Johnson at the Estado Mayor (Headquarters) in Albacete. Johnson served as an operations officer and liaison officer, before being wounded at Jarama and assigned to training new volunteers at the Estado Mayor in Tarazona, Albacete. Sinnott likely served non-combatant roles in war and stayed at Estado Mayor to support the Brigades. After spending a year volunteering in the war, he returned on the Champlain from Le Havre, France and landed in New York on July 20th, 1938. There are little to no records about his life after the Spanish Civil War, but some information shows he didn&rsquo;t stop his travel activities, as another travel record indicates Sinnott returning from Reykjavik, Iceland to New York in October, 1955.

        "data": "<p>George Watt was born Israel Kwatt, a year before the Great War, on November 5, 1913. Living in East Harlem in his youth, he came from a firmly leftist upbringing. His parents were both proud working-class socialists. His father was a silversmith, jeweler, and general metalworker. Though ethnically Jewish, his mother and father were atheists, despite the religious orthodoxy of his grandparents. His paternal grandfather had been a proud socialist as well, being one of the leaders of the first textile strike in their Polish hometown of Lotz. Strikes were illegal under the Czar, so he was arrested, put in chains, and ordered to march back to his native village as an example to the others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watt had joined the Young Communist League in high school, successfully protesting the school&#39;s attempt to raise the meal costs. He attended Brooklyn college in 1931, before transferring to Cooper Union to study Engineering between 1933-1935. He dropped out to become a full time student organizer for the Communist National Student League. It was at that point he changed his name to obscure his Jewish roots, though much later in life he said he regretted that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He recruited others for the war before joining himself. He fought for most of the war and suffered several, luckily non-fatal, injuries. All the while, he continued to write to his wife and many of those letters are preserved in the Tamiment archives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Aragon Offensive, a bullet went clean through his arm and grazed his chest, leaving a lasting scar he would go on to proudly show his children. During the Battle Of Gandesa (1938), the Lincoln battalion and its British counterpart defended a hilltop against the Nationalists. They were surrounded, and communication had gone silent. Countless died. A few, Watt included, escaped by swimming, naked except for berets with their ID cards hidden in them, down the frigid, rapid, and rocky Ebro river. Six drowned, but eight survived. They briefly met Ernest Hemingway and Herbert Mathews, before rejoining the rest of their brigade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watt was once again wounded while serving at Fuentes de Ebro. While recovering, he gave a flag bearing the words &ldquo;American Students Union&rdquo; to the Federal Union of Spanish Students in a gesture of international solidarity. He served at the Ebro Offensive, and during his last 7 months in Spain served as the political commissar of the Lincoln Battalion. One can cynically note none of his actions as a Comintern political commissar were recorded. That being said, as a commisar he was said to have been &quot;dearly loved&quot;, while other commisars were not described so kindly. He was described as &quot;ever youthful&quot;, and would fight while wounded instead of recovering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Ebro retreats, he and his unit were saved by Ralph Wilkinson Wardlaw and another rifleman. The two riflemen were in the rearguard and covered the unit&#39;s retreat, laying down their lives in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon returning, he and his wife Ruth had a son, Daniel Watt. Sadly, Ruth died unexpectedly soon after he was born. George remarried, this time to Margaret, a very close friend of the couple (all three were involved in leftist organizing together).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Margaret loved and treated Daniel like her own son, and it was reciprocated. Eventually, he learned the truth when Ruth&#39;s mother screamed at him that &quot;Margie&quot; was not his real mother. Daniel was upset at first, but still accepted Margie as his mother. If not by blood then by the ties that bind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Daniel was barely two years old, George went on to become a sergeant in the US Air Force during WWII. It was initially very difficult because the U.S government was at first unwilling to allow Spanish Civil War veterans to join, then unwilling to send them into action, for being &ldquo;prematurely anti-fascist&rdquo;. They later changed this policy as they needed more men. Decades later, he wrote a memoir about his experience being shot down in Belgium on his 30th birthday, parachuting out of the plane before making his way back home, then traveling through Franco&rsquo;s Spain, called &ldquo;The Comet Connection: Escape from Hitler&#39;s Europe&rdquo; in 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His whole family, partially representing the Communist Party in alliance with the NAACP, the Labor Party, and the local unions, was involved in protesting the lynching of Charles, Alphonzo, Richard, and Joseph Ferguson, unarmed Black WWII veterans in full uniform, who were shot by a white police officer for attempting to order coffee in a whites only establishment. Sadly, despite all they did, those pigs responsible were never held accountable. This was the psyche that embodied his family, he never stopped instilling his revolutionary spirit in his children, always encouraging them to fight injustice whenever and wherever they could. His family always sang leftist songs together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout his life, he would covertly disappear for weeks to months at a time, carrying out the orders of the communist party. Throughout the Cold War, the FBI wiretapped him. While they never got any conclusive evidence, he later recounted how he helped the Communist party set up underground systems for when the US government would inevitably crack down on them. Gene Dennis, the executive secretary of the Communist party, tasked him with finding places the leadership could hide in Mexico should the time come. So under the pretense of a family vacation, Watt got in contact with a comrade who had been living there, preparing for this very eventuality, and built a secret network of operatives. The plan was that when the leaders were arrested, some chosen reserve leaders would flee and run the party from underground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1951 in &ldquo;Dennis vs. United States&rdquo;, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeals of the Communists convicted in the Smith Act trials. George, along with many who were close to him, including Gil Green, Gus Hall, and Gene Dennis, jumped bail and escaped. George, having fought behind enemy lines in two wars, helped sneak them away into Mexico, then hid there for months. When trying to escort his charges to the safety of the Soviet Union, they were captured in a motel by Mexico City by the Mexican secret police. Gus was extradited to the US, but George remained in hiding in Mexico City, unsure of who the leak was. He was convinced it was a mole deep within the party leadership, which would explain why nobody was willing to blow their cover testifying against him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Margaret went to a safe contact and got in touch, and within three months the Communist Party had arranged his safe return to the US. When he finally got back, his little boy Daniel was already a teenager attending the Bronx High School of Science. George then became an underground organizer in western Pennsylvania, specifically near Pittsburgh, where the bosses were particularly brutal in suppressing working-class organizing. His placement there was partially a punishment for failing to get Gus Hall to safety. During this time he worked with numerous unions and covert Communists, often sending messages in code to help the labor movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this atmosphere he grew suspicious of redecorating going on in an apartment next door, but by then it was too late. The FBI came in guns drawn and arrested him November 4, 1953, just one day before his 40th birthday. His bail was set at $25,000. His lawyers argued it should be released due to his heroism escaping from behind Nazi lines. The prosecution riposted that because he was so good at escaping, the bail should in fact be doubled. Eventually, the bail was reduced to $10,000, which his family financed with a second mortgage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the trial came after two years of waiting, the prosecution sought to prove that being a Communist was inherently violent, citing the Communist Manifesto as well as the writings of Lenin and Stalin, all without context. The defense countered with the revisionist party line that the path to socialism in advanced capitalist states was peaceful, as opposed to the violence necessary to overthrow the feudal system in Russia. Eventually, he was convicted with the testimony of a paid informant (&ldquo;stool pigeon&rdquo; was the term that was used) and supposed longtime family friend, Alexander Wright. George was deeply shaken by this betrayal. This was especially painful considering George served as the party&rsquo;s &ldquo;security officer&rdquo;, identifying FBI agents and informants. Despite this, those on trial continued all the way in general good spirits, with the customary Communist optimism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1958 he split with the party, following his initial disbelief but final acceptance of Khrushchev&#39;s denunciation of Stalin and his revulsion with the Soviet invasion of Hungary. Though the hard-liners had insisted on following Soviet leadership after the revelations, George had initially tried to democratize the party and steer it away from Soviet goals. It was around this time the indictment was finally overturned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having spent nearly all his life as a member of the Communist Party, a professional revolutionary, so to speak, he had no employable skills to speak of. At the unconventional age of 46, he became apprenticed as a journeyman printer by his friends in the industry. Soon after, he went back to Brooklyn College, taking night courses to complete the bachelor&rsquo;s degree he&rsquo;d abandoned so long ago. He went on to graduate in social work, working as an administrator of the Community Mental Health Center in Brooklyn from 1968-1982. He died July, 1994 at the age of 80 due to cancer, survived by his sons, Steven and Daniel, his wife, 4 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Paul White was born in 1909 in New York City. He spent one year in a New York City high school and two years in the U.S. Army. He then worked on the East Coast waterfront with his friend Joe Bianca and became an official in the Seaman&#39;s Union. He was also a member of the American Communist Party. Upon the outbreak of the coup d&#39;&eacute;tat against the Republic and the Popular Front in 1936, White and his friend Bianca joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade to fight for the Communist Party and against fascism during the Spanish Civil War.<br />\r\nWhite arrived in Spain in May of 1937. He worked under Robert Merrian to organize transporting the Battalion to the Aragon battlefront. In August of 1937, White was sent on a mission to collect the leftover American soldiers in Madrid and bring them to the frontline. White and his partner Edwin Rolfe achieved the near-impossible task and managed to collect full rations and most of the soldiers all within six hour.<br />\r\nAfter the Republic&#39;s defeats in the Argon front, White along with other members of the Brigade left without permission because they claimed that their contracts had expired and they should be allowed to return home. They were arrested and sent back to the frontline, but White stole an automobile to escape towards the French border. White was arrested in Catalonia and David Doran, the brigade commissar at the time, believed White should be executed for desertion. However, Doran was overruled and White was sent back to the frontline.<br />\r\nAfter that incident, White was afraid of fighting in battles again because he felt the Republic was doomed and all the fighting would be futile. In March 1938, White was sent to get supplies and ammunition, but he tried to escape again towards the French border. As White approached the border and saw deserters and troops, his fear grew as he realized that even if he did escape, he would still have to face everyone back home and live under the name of a deserter. At the same time, he heard that his wife had given birth to his son and began to regret what he had done, because he wanted to set a great example for his son and wanted his son to be proud of him. White was arrested soon after in a town near the border, but he viewed it as a way to save him from completely wrecking his life. He then returned to the frontline and confessed his actions. White admitted that his escape to safety would not have protected him from the loss of everything and everyone he loves, and he asks for another chance to serve in his ranks in order to redeem himself and erase this stain on his military record.<br />\r\nIn April, 1938, White was charged with desertion, and his battalion officer John Gates, who was known to be a strict disciplinarian, ordered him to be executed. White&rsquo;s execution was done secretly at night without anyone in the Battalion knowing the detail and reason of it. The next day it was announced that White had been executed as a deserter by the unanimous decision of the battalion, but it was not the case since most of the battalion did know about the execution. This caused huge controversies within the battalion, including White&rsquo;s friend Joe Bianca shouting &ldquo;those sons of bitches!&rdquo; at the commanders. Because of these dissents, it was quickly announced that no further execution would take place within the Abraham Lincoln Battalion. According to John Gates, the day after White&rsquo;s execution, an order came down from the Division to countermand the execution.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Leon Rosenthal was a New Yorker of Jewish descent who enlisted to fight in Spain when he was 26 years old. Little is known about Rosenthal&rsquo;s early life, although he was a registered member of the United Electrical Workers Union, as well as an amateur astronomer. When he left for Spain, he was planning on becoming a scientist upon his return. At the time of his departure, he lived at 380 3rd Ave in Brooklyn, in what is now Park Slope. Funnily enough, where he once lived is now down the block from Battalion Studios, a local recording studio.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    As was common among union members at the time, Rosenthal was most likely a socialist, and certainly a virulent antifascist. However, before he could travel to Spain to fight for what he saw to be a most necessary cause, he had one bureaucratic obstacle to overcome - obtaining a passport. Rosenthal got his passport in late April 1937 and set sail for Spain aboard the Aquitania on May 12th, 1937. Once he arrived, it was not long before he would be put into action on the front.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Most of what is known about Rosenthal can be gleaned from letters he wrote to his wife, Lee, which detail his day-to-day activities, as well as his hopes of defeating fascism and returning home again to &ldquo;start a brand new romance together&rdquo; with his wife, who also volunteered to help the Republic from her home in Brooklyn. These letters have additional historical significance as Rosenthal&rsquo;s descriptions of his experiences working in a Republican propaganda sound truck are thought to be the first of their kind.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Rosenthal&rsquo;s work in the propaganda truck involved printing and distributing leaflets, as well as driving right up to the front and going through a full propaganda campaign with speakers to attract fascist deserters. Him and two others ran the truck, but they were assisted by former deserters and other Spaniards who made speeches throughout the night. The nightly broadcast would start with a playing of the Spanish national anthem, Himno de Riego, followed by a speech by a poet or some other young intellectual updating the whole front on the latest news and speaking of the politics behind the war. After that, the microphone would be handed to a fascist deserter, who would try to convince his comrades to follow him by talking about how much better he was treated on the Republican side. The broadcast would finish with a playing of the Internationale. This tactic was extremely effective, with Rosenthal noting that his team was able to attract 20 fascist deserters in one particularly strong night of work.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Rosenthal&rsquo;s unique line of work made him different from most of his fellow American volunteers, and in fact he was rarely (if ever) actually with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. His truck was itself an independent unit under the 45th Battalion. In August and September of 1937, Rosenthal spent time on the Zaragoza front with the Polish Dombrowski Battalion as well as briefly spending some time with the Italian Garibaldi Brigade.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    After working on the Zaragoza front, Rosenthal and his truck moved to the Extremadura Front. It was there, on February 27th, 1938, that Rosenthal&rsquo;s truck was unfortunately hit with a bomb from a fascist plane. Only one picture of Rosenthal survives today. Interestingly enough, this picture has also been attributed to another Leon Rosenthal, a American volunteer from Los Angeles who served in the Canadian Mackenzie Papineau Battalion under the name Carl Nitzberg. However, per the official archives of the Abraham Lincoln Brigades, the photograph in question is of the Rosenthal described above.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Leon Rosenthal never did achieve his dream of becoming a scientist. Like so many others of his time, the evils of fascism cut his life tragically short. However, he sacrificed his life for a cause that he truly believed in, and that is an honor that very few can claim.</p>\r\n    ",

        "data": "<p>John Wegrzynek was born in a small town called Iskrzynia in southern Poland, on October 20th, 1901 to Stanislaw and Marianna Wegrzynek. He sailed to the US along with his parents and his sibling aboard the SS Vanderland from Antwerp, Belgium. Upon arrival, his family stayed with relatives in Buffalo, New York and became naturalized (receiving Passport #372703). Much like other Poles during the time in industrial cities, he was attracted to metalworking and he remained in the trade for much of his 20&rsquo;s and early 30&rsquo;s. This job provided him with financial security, allowing him to move to New York City where he resided at 239 E 13th Street in Manhattan. In 1937, he registered under the Communist Party, placing him on various watchlists in the US government. Upon enlisting in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (in the &ldquo;terra corps&rdquo;), he immediately became a point of interest in the eyes of intelligence agencies who reported on the ties between the Communists and the XV Brigade. In the purest version of McCarthy-ism, just like many of his fellow Communist Party members, he was suspected of forging documents and espionage by the Special Committee on Un-American Activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At 36 years of age, Wegrzynek set sail to Spain on March 18th, 1937 aboard the Normandie. Along with numerous other Polish volunteers, he arrived on April 2nd. Little is known about his time in Spain, however, as there are practically no records of him serving shoulder to shoulder with the XV Brigade, it is likely that he served in the Palafox Battalion (a part of the larger Dabrowski Brigade) much like many other Poles in his timeframe there. On a short slip of paper, he was described in Spanish by his peers as being &ldquo;...very well developed politically&hellip;&rdquo; and &ldquo;...very active.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After serving in Spain for a year and three months, he returned to New York City aboard the Champlain on July 20th, 1938. Nothing is known about his activity in the U.S. after his deployment. He did not join any veterans&rsquo; associations, unions, nor did he participate in any censuses or get married. He is survived by his niece, who recognized his face in an identification effort on a forum.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Salaria Lillie Kea was an African American woman born July 13, 1913 in Milledgeville, Georgia. Salaria&rsquo;s father was killed in WWI in 1914: he was a seaman, whose ship got blown up in international waters. As a result, she never met her father. She had 3 brothers, all of whom grew up in different states but whom she never lost contact with; Andrew, who grew up in Chicago, George, who lived in Key West, Florida, and Arthur who resided in North Carolina, living with their mother&rsquo;s only sister. Salaria, on the other hand, was taken to her mother&rsquo;s father, a Caucasian man named Samuel Moses III, living in Akron, Ohio. He was the one who set up Salaria with her foster family, the Jacksons, when she was three years old. Her foster mother was a schoolteacher who had to travel to Kentucky to teach due to race restrictions on teaching in their hometown, which was a prelude to the kind of racial restrictions Salaria would face in her life as a result of the profession she would eventually pursue. Salaria was mostly taken care of by her foster father and grandmother, who owned a grocery store in town, but she went on to live with another family, the Harris Family, whose mother was also a schoolteacher. With the amount of school teachers in her life, Salaria at a young age wanted to be a schoolteacher, not knowing her destiny lay far beyond the borders of her hometown&rsquo;s school system. When her oldest brother, Andrew, got married, he moved to Akron as well to support his little sister, and she moved in with him at his new home on Scott Avenue and Livingston Place, living with a close family member for the first time since her parents&rsquo; deaths. Because of her change in residence, she was allowed to transfer from Central High School in Akron to West High School, a major step up for her due to the former school prohibiting her participation in athletics as a result of her race. She was able to graduate from West High School as a well-known athlete and student, known in school as &ldquo;Rodeo&rdquo; and &ldquo;SubKee&rdquo;. These were nicknames she earned as a result of her athletic prowess, which apparently allowed her to substitute in any sport, including baseball and volleyball. She was also valedictorian of her high school in 1930, and by that time she had decided to be a nurse as opposed to a school teacher, having gotten a job with a man named Dr. Riddle when she was fifteen years old. At this job, she worked in his office after school and on Saturdays, and during the summer she would unlock his office every day at 8am, scheduling appointments and taking calls on his behalf. Thanks to this job, she learned how to take a pulse, temperature, respiration measurements and such, studying under his wing for the entire time she worked there. She also learned about anatomy on a fake skeleton in his office with removable parts, where she would teach herself the anatomy of the human body. This job impacted her life so much and so quickly, she even decided to take Latin all 4 years of high school, because she realized there was so much Latin in medicine, having a background on the language could further improve her learning capabilities in the subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After graduation, Salaria made the decision to apply to nursing school, but all three nursing schools in her region denied her entry because of her race. So, her brother took the refusal letters she had received from the three schools and gave them to a woman named Mrs. Fristone, who sent the letters to Mrs. Roosevelt, wife of the Governor of New York at the time, Franklin D. Roosevelt. She replied (not directly to Salaria, however), and soon enough, two coordinators were sent out to Akron to interview Salaria, one of which being Mrs. Estelle Massey Osborn, a prominent nurse battling discrimination in the nursing world. After her interview, Salaria was sent a letter from New York&rsquo;s Department of Hospitals, stating that she had to go to Columbus, Ohio to take the entrance exam to enter the schools in New York. Soon enough, she was accepted and was to attend school at Bellevue Hospital, the Mother School of the Harlem Hospital School of Nursing. Here, she obtained a college degree, and she was actively involved in the racial integration of the hospital&rsquo;s dining room during her time there. Her activeness against racial discrimination showed its true colors during her time in New York City, with her joining organizations like the NAACP, furthering her involvement in the civil rights movement while going through her education. After graduating in 1934, she began work at Sea View Hospital at the No-Return Unit for tuberculosis patients. At that time, out of the 26 hospitals that New York City owned, black nurses could only work in 4: Sea View, Harlem Hospital, Metropolitan, and Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. Working at Sea View, blacks were only allowed to work with tuberculosis patients, as there was great risk of infection working with these patients and white nurses and doctors saw this duty as too risky for them to partake in. White doctors never even entered the floor with the terminal cases, giving orders and instructions and receiving reports about patients in the Nursing Office only. Salaria was lucky enough to never have gotten the disease, unlike many of her previous classmates, who died as a result of exposure to the terminal patients. Lucky her; Salaria only weighed 97 pounds when she was in the unit, and catching the disease would surely have been a death sentence.There was an organization at the time fighting against having black nurses serving only in the tuberculosis units in New York City. A meeting was held with the leaders of the Department of Hospitals in New York City, a meeting which Salaria attended, listening to the discussion of the reasons for limiting the colored nurses to these 4 hospitals. The President of all the hospitals made a speech at this large meeting, stating that the reasons for these limitations was that, in twenty years, there wouldn&rsquo;t be a colored problem in the United States anymore, because they will all be dead of tuberculosis. The room went dead silent, but Salaria, 24 years old at the time, stood up, holding up her head, and shouting to the President directly &ldquo;And you are trying to make the dead lie [down].&rdquo; The next day at Sea View, after she spoke at the Department of Hospital meeting, a doctor came in and removed her from the tuberculosis unit and put her in the employee&rsquo;s clinic, and she never worked in the tuberculosis unit again. In 1936, she went to work at Harlem Hospital, the place she had learned nursing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kea&rsquo;s activism continued, as she collected money and medical supplies for a seventy-five bed field hospital for those suffering at the hands of Mussolini during his war against Ethiopia. Being in New York, she began to be influenced by left-wing groups and joined the Communist Party in 1935. At the end of 1936, while Salaria was still at Harlem, she heard about a flood that had affected parts of Ohio and Kentucky, and a bulletin board in her hospital was asking for volunteer medical personnel as members of the Red Cross. Salaria took the day off with some fellow English nurses to go and secure a spot as a volunteer; however, she was rejected once again on account of her race. Fortunately, the doctors who had gone to volunteer with her not only demanded a written statement that could support Red Cross&rsquo;s rejection of Salaria, but a French doctor working at the hospital at the time took the statement to the French Embassy in New York. She was called down to the embassy, and instead of eventually being told she could work on the flood case in Ohio, she was accepted to go to France in February of 1937 with a medical unit to serve in Spain. By March 15th she had passed all tests and examinations required of volunteers in Spain, and resigned from Harlem hospital to leave for her new job across the Atlantic. She left New York on March 27, 1937, as part of the 3rd group of doctors and nurses from America going to Spain to serve in the Spanish Civil War as part of the AMB, the American Medical Bureau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the beginning of Salaria&rsquo;s travels to Spain, she sat with 12 nurses and doctors, and it was clear to her that she was the only black person in the group. The head doctor, Dr. Pitts, who was in charge of the medical unit, made a scene about her being there and sitting at his table for lunch. Doctors and nurses aren&rsquo;t allowed to sit down until the head doctor does, but he refused to sit down because of Salaria, screaming to the waiter &ldquo;I have never sat at a table with a n***er wench and I&rsquo;m not gonna start now.&rdquo; The captain, who was French, along with one of the owners of the shipping line, were brought down to resolve the &ldquo;issue,&rdquo; but instead he offered Kea a first-class seat on the ship, and she roomed with the owner of the shipping line the rest of the way to France, not seeing her medical unit again until they got off the ship. She landed in France on April 3rd in the Mediterranean water of Port Bou, Gerona. When she got off the French ship, many French people took her in, and she and her roommate, who was a journalist, were featured on a postcard that went all over France and Spain. She lived in a top hotel in France until it was time to go to Spain, leaving for Spain a little while after the original American nurses and doctors she had travelled with had gone. Traveling with the reporter and the French group of doctors and nurses to the International Medical Unit, she was stationed at the hospital set up at Villa Paz, one of King Alfonso&rsquo;s summer homes. When she arrived at &ldquo;Hospital Americano No. 1&rdquo;she found she had support from all the nurses and doctors there, since they were all from the North, unlike Dr. Pitts, the Head Doctor, who was actually from the South. Many of the doctors were actually from New York, so she was familiar with some of the people she was surrounded by. Salaria, a surgical nurse, was the only black nurse of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. A result, she gained popularity very quickly, even featuring for a few seconds in two renowned propaganda documentaries in support of the Republic: Heart of Spain directed by Herbert Kline (1937), and Victoire de la vie (Return to Life) directed by Henri Carier Bresson and Herbert Kline (1937). Kea was also married to her husband, Irish brigadier John P. O&rsquo;Reilly, in a civil wedding in 1937.After working at the Villa Paz hospital for 4-5 months, Salaria was transferred to the Mobile Hospital Unit. She was sent to various areas where bombings had occurred, and her job consisted of picking up dead bodies and burying them, as well as helping the wounded. After treating the wounded, they were sent off to the hospital, and she continued on with her Mobile Unit. She went back to the hospital occasionally, only until she was sent to another place. At many of these war-torn villages, Salaria found nothing but children, with 50 to 100 in one place without any parents, as young as 2 years old. Salaria recounts being taken by the young children down to a brook to eat frogs, and seeing them use slingshots to shoot birds. The children also knew the correct plants to eat, which was how they survived until the nurses gave them proper food. Other villages had older people and many wounded civilians, with multiple international doctors assessing and diagnosing patients, including some Indian doctors. One time, her unit went to a cave, which is something Salaria had never been in before. She found a lot of space, and two cords; one red one which led you in, and a green cord which led you out. There were a lot of blankets without beds, some mattresses on the floor, and the floor was all sand. The first night, all Salaria had was her cape and a blanket she had been given to sleep on (she was given a mattress the next night). She was to help feed and take care of the children and make sure they stayed as healthy as possible. Some people she found during her time with the unit were so wounded they couldn&#39;t move and had to be treated on sight until they were well enough to be carried to a nearby hospital. When she was sent to the Front Lines, with her unit, she remembers being on a hill with the enemies, who were on the other side from her position. She says the enemies used to throw over grenades, and she could only watch as numerous comrades of hers got wounded or were killed. She had to pick them up and bring them down as it kept happening. The soldiers were taken care of in the Mobile Unit, and the cycle continued for a very long time, ending only when the fighting on that hill died down. The unit took their wounded to the closest hospital they could find, which was far because she was stationed in the North at the time, meanwhile the South was where most of their hospitals were stationed. There are two stories about her getting separated from her medical unit during the Spanish Civil War, both of which involve her disgruntled superior, Dr. Pitts. In her first account, she was in the front ambulance with Dr. Pitts, coming from Northern Spain back down South because the Fascists were moving down, so they were assisting a village holding a massive evacuation. According to Salaria, there were so many people and possessions coming out of the village, with animals and supplies tied onto citizens escaping, that it looked like a march. While driving, Dr. Pitts told Salaria to go down the line and make sure everyone that was exiting the village was in line. Salaria had to walk all the way down the hoard of people to make sure everyone from the village was where they were supposed to be, and when she had done that she made her way back towards the ambulance. However, she never found the ambulance, having been abandoned by the Unit (accidentally or not, she still doesn&rsquo;t know).This was the first time she had ever gotten lost in Spain, and she walked and walked until around 12am, in March 1938. She was in a patch of woods all alone, deciding to lay down and fall asleep, awakened by a dog who patted her with his paw. She got up, and began following the dog down the hill, when all of a sudden, she spotted a priest with a hoard of sheep so large she thought it was Christ. The dog with Salaria barked at the priest, who bid Salaria to come down the hill with him. He asked her if she was Salaria Kea, to which she replied yes, wondering how the man knew her name. In response, he pulled out the same postcard with the French journalist and her that had been sent all over France when she had arrived in Europe. She told the priest what had happened to her, and the priest said he knew where her group was, and that the dog that had found her would lead her to a bridge across the Ebro River, where someone would meet her on the other side and take her to her station. The priest gave her something to eat, and she was kissed goodbye before walking half a day to the bridge, only to find that it had been blown up. She was planning to swim across the river, telling the dog to stay on the other side while she swam across and keep watch, when all of a sudden she heard a German accent from across the river. She got behind a tree to inspect the people who had spoken, but she saw men dressed in grey, which to her relief meant they were on her side. She finally revealed herself from the bushes, and the man who was previously speaking German greeted her in English, telling her how they had come to retrieve her and bring her from across the river back to her hospital. While one of the men prepared to swim to get Salaria, she brushed them off and told them she could swim just fine. She was greeted on the other side by a larger group of men with guns with orders to retrieve Salaria for her medical unit. She was taken on an ambulance truck back to a hospital where she then worked for a couple of weeks. Funnily enough, Dr. Pitts was there too, but instead of making a big deal of what had happened, Salaria never said a word about it to him, never believing that it had been done on purpose. Salaria&rsquo;s second story was closer to the end of the war, when Salaria and her team were far up North again, and she found herself traveling yet again with Dr. Pitts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were in a different part of Spain than before, stopping at various villages to pick up the sick and wounded, never staying more than a couple of days at one place. One time, they stopped at a huge building, where a loud scream and a child crying inside was heard. She was told by Dr. Pitts to bring whomever was inside with her back to the ambulance, and she went inside to find the people responsible for the sound. She called in Spanish for someone, but didn&rsquo;t get a single reply, waiting for some time before heading back outside. However, when she went back out, everything, including her ambulance, was gone. So, she did the only thing she could do; she began to walk, walking until she thought she heard a car coming for her. She then stepped on the side of the road, waiting, but what she saw coming down the road was not a familiar vehicle, but a huge black car, with German Fascist soldiers dressed in their uniforms. Salaria ran as the soldiers began to shoot at her, swerving through trees until one shot banged a branch off a tree and hit Salaria in the head. Two German soldiers rushed up to her, speaking in German, which Salaria couldn&rsquo;t understand. She was picked up and brought back to the car, being forced to walk outside, with the car driving right beside her. She was planning to fake a fall when they got to a certain point, and act like she couldn&rsquo;t get up, but before that happened, Salaria fell accidentally. Because of that, she was seated right next to the driver of the car, who drove her all the way to a huge building that would be her prison. She was situated 5 flights underground, and in that prison she was left alone with cement bunks and no windows to the outside. Every couple of days the guards would bring her a coconut shell filled with soupy rice that she would have to eat to stay alive. The door had a window with bars where food could be slipped through, and one Spaniard woman used to slip Salaria cookies and bread. The whole time she was there, Salaria wore the same clothes and studied the Bible, having been given it 3 days after her imprisonment by the Spaniard woman at the prison so as to not lose her sanity. One early morning, Salaria was taken to look outside a window on the first flight above the ground, where she saw a tall grey wall. Men, women, and children of all ages were lined up, and she noted how some women were pregnant, and they were lined up in-between German soldiers with guns, 12 on either side. Salaria watched as the Germans outside were given the order to fire, and they shot the citizens who dropped to the floor like flies. There were some relatives of these people forced to watch the same way Salaria was, who screamed at the sight, but were then forced to dispose of the bodies, wash the blood off the walls and do other basic cleanup tasks after the firing squad finished. Salaria was led back to her prison, being told by the soldiers that tomorrow could be her day to be one of those unlucky people who found themselves in-between German gunners.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was a POW for seven weeks, she estimates, and at the end of those seven weeks, after having been brought up two or three times to witness various firing squads shoot at people, she was told that tomorrow was indeed her turn to face the firing squad. However, at 2am the night before that fateful day, someone called for her through the only door leading outside, having brought down her bags and things for her. The person who opened the door was a monk, who brought Salaria up four flights of stairs and outside to a ravine, where they ran into an Englishman with a flashlight, who led them further down. Later they ran into a Canadian, who led them even further down to a wooded area where, through the trees was a train waiting for her. Salaria was put into a crowded coach, where a man who called her by her name bid her to sit down amongst a packed car of confused people, and he handed her a bag with raw eggs, which she ate out of pure hunger. There were chickens, ducks, pigs, and all sorts of fowl on the train along with the passengers, so there was little to no room for anyone on board to be comfortable. She notes how she never saw the monk, the Englishman, or the Canadian ever again, and can&rsquo;t remember their names.It was late 1938 by this time, and by 1 o&rsquo;clock the next day, the train stopped and the passengers were told they could get off. At a restaurant on the hill, Salaria and a group of people went to grab lunch, and decided to eat and relax in a small forest nearby. However, as they were heading up there, Salaria heard planes coming over, and she and the others ran back down the hill to one of many ditches that were dug in the area to hide. She was able to grab a little girl into the trench before a bomb went off some ten feet away. She also told of a doctor, whose wife had been in the train to have a baby in France in a few weeks, but who died as a result of the planes firing on most of the passengers of the train, who were sitting outside their coaches eating lunch. The doctor was said to have wandered aimlessly after the shooting was over, until someone got a hold of him and cleaned the blood off of his non-wounded body. Despite being full before, 6 coaches were empty now as a result of the amount of people who died, which left room for the wounded to board and be treated on the train. After some time, Salaria found herself on the border of France, and stayed for three to four weeks in a hotel. She was then taken on a boat to France, and was greeted by four nuns, who took Salaria to their convent, where she was blessed by the priest and treated by the resident doctor, given food and allowed to rest. For four days, Salaria stayed in bed, and when she was finally able to get up she was taken to Lourdes. She was there for one week, and after that she was taken back down to the convent, where she stayed for some time. There was a young couple living down the hill from the convent, who would take Salaria after breakfast every morning to play tennis and go places, picking flowers for the convent and such. From there, Salaria went to Paris, where she stayed until she was taken home by the British Ship, the Queen Mary, arriving in New York in January 1939. When arriving back home, Salaria toured New York City, lecturing about her experiences during the Spanish Civil War at different Catholic schools, churches and nursing schools. The NAACP, the Urban League, Girl Scouts, Nurses Association, and other organizations reached out to her to hear about her experience and wanted her to share them. To incentivise her, she never paid a dime for her housing accommodations near the different areas she would speak in. She also worked hard to be able to get her husband to immigrate to the United States, as he was a citizen of a European country, a process made doubly difficult by the face that she and her husband were an interracial couple. Time in war didn&rsquo;t end for Salaria with the Spanish Civil War, either: even though Salaria succeeded in getting her husband&rsquo;s immigration status approved (he moved to the US in 1940), he was soon drafted for World War II. Salaria served as well, beginning in 1944 when African-American women were first recruited.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the war, the couple was able to return to New York, and Salaria went on to coordinate staff desegregation in several hospitals. Salaria returned to Akron only a couple of times before retirement, going on stretches as long as 8 years long without visiting her hometown. She lived in New York City until 1973. Despite her many accomplishments and high regard from the members of the Brigade, coming back home to Akron, she was still faced with the discrimination from which she left. Firstly, like many International Brigades volunteers, Salaria&rsquo;s ties to Communism and to the Spanish Republicans hurt her job prospects upon her return to the United States. There was also trouble with her religious practices, a conflict she thought might have been resolved by the time she left for New York City.As a child, Salaria had belonged to the Catholic church; her father was a Catholic and her mother was a Methodist. However, when she was growing up, Salaria couldn&rsquo;t go to Catholic churches in Akron due to racial restrictions, so she went to a range of different Christian churches, from Presbyterian to Baptists to Methodist. One of her relatives, who was pale in skin color, was allowed to attend th Catholic church, but her own husband couldn&rsquo;t because he was black. When she moved back to Akron after retirement, she was told by relatives and friends who brought her to various churches that they had friends in the Catholic Church who could bring her to ones she could attend. However, from August 1973 to East Week in 1974, no one ever came to tell her where she could go to Catholic Church. In 1974, on Ash Wednesday, on Grant Street and Brown was a small Hungarian Catholic Church that Salaria decided to visit to see if she could attend service there. However, the woman at the door screamed at her, asking her what she wanted and telling her to get out, saying no black people could enter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salaria stated many times how her time in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade was the happiest of her life, because that was the one place she was treated as an equal, where her skill mattered more than her race. She died May 18, 1990. One interesting fact about Salaria&rsquo;s accounts of the war is that they sometimes differ with each account. For this reason, Salaria has been accused of &ldquo;self-aggrandizing&rdquo; her memoirs for the sake of publicity and to support the civil rights cause with her stories, due to different accounts even with her early life and her parents. She has recorded giving two different accounts for her father&rsquo;s death; one with him being stabbed to death by an asylum patient while working as a gardener at the Ohio State Hospital for the Insane in Columbus, and one with him working as a seaman during World War I, with his ship blown up at sea. So, when reading her story and her experience, it&rsquo;s important to understand that Salaria was going up against resistance throughout her entire life. With the possibility that her stories were embellished, remember that no matter what, the battles she was fighting because of her race were real, and her accounts, however true they may be, ring well with the hardships she had to deal with as a result of her skin color.</p>\r\n",

She was an immigrant from Torntino, Russia, having studied nursing at Jewish Maternity Hospital Training School, and thereafter to be an X-ray technician at Hunter College. She was described as shy, being five feet four, with brown hair and eyes. She was naturalized on June 2, 1931 in the U.S. District Court at Brooklyn. Although her husband, a post office employee named Arthur Peer, warned her of the dangers of going to Spain, she left everything behind to help the efforts, just a month after she had gotten her U.S. passport in 1937. She served with the Medical Services in the Taranc&oacute;n sector. Arriving in Spain on April 11, 1937, the hospital where she was working was bombed several times, and she eventually had her ribs broken by shrapnel. Even though she herself was injured, she helped out others who had lighter injuries than herself in the aftermath of the attack. She had to be sent to Paris to recuperate from her injuries for four months. While on a ship ride to join her in Spain, her husband died due to a heart attack on December 31st. They never got to reunite. In May the following year, she went back to Spain, being responsible for the Hospital de S&#39;agar&oacute; until the end of the war in March of 1939. She was the only American nurse to be cited for bravery by the Loyalist government. Perhaps due to the fact that she participated in the Spanish efforts for freedom, which was linked to Communism, and her birthplace, Sonia&rsquo;s name was listed in the hearings before the United States Senate Committee of the Judiciary on Soviet activities within the United States. She would later marry Alex Kolkin after the war had ended in 1968 in New York City. She died in California.</p>\r\n    ",

        "data": "<p>Rubin (&ldquo;Ruby&rdquo;) Schneiderman was born on April 21, 1915, in Brooklyn, New York. His parents were Rose Zuckerman and Max Schneiderman, and he was Jewish. His father immigrated from Russia, and his mother came from Romania. He had three older brothers: Harry, Louis, and Isidore, and a younger sister: Ruth. He graduated from Osing High School in New York in three years and had no further formal education. According to the Soviet archives, Schneiderman joined the Communist Party in 1932. Possibly as a result of joining the party, he decided to acquire some military training through the Citizen&rsquo;s Military Training Camp at Fort Dix, New Jersey, for four weeks each summer from 1934-1936. CMTCs were military training programs held across the country each summer from 1921 to 1940. They were a legacy of &ldquo;preparedness camps&rdquo; created during World War I but before the US entered it, to train potential officers in the event of war. The camps taught physical fitness, discipline, and basic use of weaponry.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schneiderman was unmarried at the time of the Spanish Civil War and worked as a shipping clerk at a clothing store, organizing the union there. When he decided to volunteer in Spain, he applied for a passport and received passport number 364705 on February 1, 1937. In his passport, he had two addresses listed, one at 1273 Stebbins Avenue, in the Bronx, and the other at 1703 Union Street, in Brooklyn. His address in the Bronx was likely his primary residence. He left for Europe aboard the &ldquo;Paris&rdquo; on February 6, 1937, just five days after getting his passport. He finally arrived in Spain on February 15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schneiderman fought with the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, in the XV Brigade, first with Company 2, Section 1, Group 2, and later with Company 1. Just twelve days after arriving in Spain, he was wounded in action at the failed attack on Pingarr&oacute;n, on February 27, 1937, within the Battle of Jarama. He was soon able to recover and rejoin the fighting. He was injured again at the battle of Brunete. He then became Master Sergeant in charge of Americans at a rehabilitation center behind the front. Due to his injuries, he returned to the US on September 24, 1937, on the &ldquo;DeGrasse&rdquo;, ending his participation in the Spanish Civil War.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding Jewish volunteers in general, it is estimated that 38% of American volunteers in the war and 25% of all international volunteers were Jews. These are relatively large percentages considering that only 4% of the US population and less than 1% of the world was Jewish at the time. But despite the large number of Jews who fought, there has been relatively little mentioned about their impact because of the Soviet role as historians and archivists of the war. The Soviet Union&rsquo;s control of much of the documentation surrounding the war and their anti-Israel stance in later years led to a minimization of the important role played by Jews in the war, especially by American and British historians. In many cases, historians emphasized the socialist beliefs that many Jews held rather than the additional factor that Judaism played for so many in their desire to fight fascism. But despite Jews being ignored internationally, in Spain, there has always been open recognition of the many Jews who came to fight. Moreover, many Jews used aliases to hide their religion, so the real number who volunteered could potentially be much higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After serving in the Spanish Civil War, Schneiderman got married at some point before October 16, 1940, to a woman named Dorothy. He enlisted in the US Army as a Private on May 5, 1943, soon after he turned 28 years old. Despite all of his experience from the Spanish Civil War, he would serve stateside during World War II. It is possible that like many veterans of the International Brigades, he was discriminated against during World War II because of his perceived Communist beliefs. There was no formal policy of discrimination, but many veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion complained about how they weren&rsquo;t given an opportunity to fight in Europe despite their combat experience. In a letter Schneiderman sent in May of 1943 to someone named Jack, (most likely Jack Bjoze, the Executive Secretary of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade at the time), he wrote, &ldquo;I got 128 on the army test and you only need 110-120 for officers school. After the test I got an [...] interview about the [Abraham Lincoln] Brigade and then they put &lsquo;Probable leadership&rsquo; down on my papers which is promising.&rdquo; But despite his qualifications, Schneiderman was sent to an M.P (military police) training center at Fort Ontario. In another letter to Jack, he told him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had some interesting talks with my Louie [Lieutenant] and also the Public Relations and Intelligence officer here at the Post and I told them all about my Spain experience. He seemed very much interested but said I could do nothing about getting out of limited service because my eyes are 20/40 without glasses, but they can&rsquo;t keep a good man down or as the saying goes, &lsquo;talent will win out&rsquo;.&rdquo; In a letter from a year later, Schneiderman wrote, &ldquo;I was DISQUALIFIED for overseas service on two counts, eyes and feet and between you and I, I can&rsquo;t honestly say it was a surprise to me.&rdquo; But he still stayed upbeat, joking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been destined to be an M.P. ever since I stopped a fight between two 9 year old kids, 10 years ago.&rdquo; The thing that stands out the most from Schneiderman&rsquo;s letters is his positive attitude despite being confined to a non-combat role. Schneiderman would serve as an M.P. at various military prisons and POW camps for the duration of the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was released from the army on March 11, 1946. Rubin Schneiderman died on June 11, 2001, at the age of 86, in Charlottesville, Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>William &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; McCarthy was born on June 22, 1912 in NYC. When Bill was six years old, his father died from a diabetic coma. With few resources, Bill was forced to move from the Upper West Side to the slums of Brooklyn. Following his father&rsquo;s death, Bill&rsquo;s family worked with a social worker who helped manage finances and provide care; his mother did not work until Bill was an adult and she worked at telephone answering service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the death of his father, Bill quickly became the head of the family. He first attended a parochial school, St. John&#39;s College Jesuit High School, where the Jesuit fathers singled him out for future priesthood. The Jesuits offered Bill a scholarship to Brooklyn Prep; during his time there, Bill was trained by the National Guard - he learnt to ride a horse and load weapons - and his experience made him valuable later on in Spain. Bill was supposed to attend Holy Cross, but the Great Depression hit and he could not afford to attend. He then began working on Wall Street after graduating from St. Johns. During the Depression, Bill worked 18-hour days as a bellboy for a meager $30 a month. What discouraged Bill most was working long, cumbersome hours and later being robbed. After losing his job as a bellboy in 1936, he became a sailor. Unfortunately, the union Bill now belonged to- the Marine Industrial Union - was full of philanderers; Bill grew so frustrated that he helped create a new union of which he became the first business agent for in 1937.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill decided to go to Spain once he found out he would be paid for being a business agent for his union and could send back money to his family. He travelled to Spain in 1937 and entered through France, first landing in Paris and from there traveling through the Pyrenees. He was guided by Spanish guards and smugglers who took them along smuggler routes. Once in Spain, he was among over 40,000 other international volunteers; they first travelled to Figueras in Catalonia and stayed in the Sant Ferran Castle, an old Spanish fortress while on their way to serve. They finally arrived in Barcelona, where the anarchists rejected the internationals. From Barcelona, Bill alongside the rest of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, travelled to Albacete where the group received extremely rudimentary training - such as how to load a gun and its different parts. Because of his training in his school years, Bill was considered valuable in Spain. The first battle in which he fought was in Aragon in late September of 1937 when the Republic went on the offensive. During this battle, the Abraham Lincoln Brigade successfully captured Belchite and while in resting position, Bill met Ernest Hemingway and Martha Gellhorn, who were married at the time. The couple offered food, resources, and their hotel room to the members of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, which many in the brigade took advantage of.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his time in Belchite, following the capture of the town, Bill was hit by a concussion grenade, dropping him in a crash of shrapnel and ruble and severely injuring him and five of his fellow soldiers. As per his brigade commissar&rsquo;s orders, Bill and the five others injured were sent to a hospital which Bill described was for &ldquo;cracked out&rdquo; people (mentally ill). After a year in the hospital, Bill sought to volunteer once again after hearing of Mussolini&rsquo;s continued success in Spain. In 1939, while serving in Genoa and contacting Italian anti-fascists, Bill was captured for drunkenly slandering Il Duce - Mussolini. Once captured, he was abused and tortured by fascist forces, including being forced to drink castor oil. Though his sentence was supposed to be only two weeks, Bill was only released after three months once his wife Shirley, along with other seamen from Bill&rsquo;s crew, pushed Roosevelt&rsquo;s state department to pressure Mussolini for Bill&rsquo;s release.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twelve years later, Bill remained committed to his fight against anti-fascism and freedom. In 1951, during a protest against the Korean War in Union Square, NY, Bill was arrested and beaten by New York City police for climbing a lamppost and spewing anti-war rhetoric. The policemen repeatedly stomped on Bill and kicked him, causing permanent damage to his left eye. Bill&rsquo;s physical health continued to deteriorate and towards the end of his life, he became an alcoholic. Though Bill suffered greatly in his final days, he supported the anti-fascist cause till the end. Throughout his life, he was awarded several honors and even became an Executive Committee member in the National Maritime Union (NMU). Bill McCarthy was also closely acquainted with Bill Bailey, whom McCarthy requested, &ldquo;if I pass on before you, would you promise me, now, that you will get my ashes to Spain and bury them at Belchite so I can rest at peace among my brave comrades and friends who died in the war?&rdquo; Bill Bailey honored this request when Bill McCarthy passed away in 1987.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Gresham dreamed of being a carny and a writer, feeling that he wasn&rsquo;t fit for a normal day job. Upon graduating from Erasmus Hall in 1926, he kept true to that sentiment, working as a folk singer in Greenwich village while continuing to write.&nbsp; This same anti-establishment sentiment pushed him towards joining the Communist Party, where he and his future wife Joy Davidman would become active members.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With no set jobs or commitments in NYC, his leftist stance encouraged him to become a volunteer medic on the Loyalist side during the Spanish Civil War.&nbsp; While serving during the war, he by chance met a former sideshow employee named Joseph Daniel &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; Halliday.&nbsp; They became great friends, and bonded over the sideshow that was such a major influence on Gresham.&nbsp; Their long conversations would inspire Gresham&rsquo;s future works, particularly <em>Monster Midway </em>and <em>Nightmare Ally.&nbsp; </em>Gresham also tended to be a heavy drinker, being described as destructive and violent.&nbsp; While enlisted, Gresham attempted to hang himself with his belt, only surviving due to the hook in the wall giving way.&nbsp; He then returned to America in 1939 at the age of 30 after he contracted tuberculosis and was placed in the tuberculosis ward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The war had taken an immense toll on Gresham, and writing offered him therapeutic clarity. In 1946 he gained massive fame for his novel <em>Nightmare Ally, </em>a kind of autobiography where he describes a preacher&#39;s decline into a drunken carnival geek.&nbsp; But this recently gained fame was hard on Gresham, and he cracked under the pressure to write another successful novel.&nbsp; His drinking became worse, and he began to abuse both his children and his wife.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t deal with his continued failure and his lack of belonging, driving away both his wife and his children, with his wife leaving him to escape to the UK.&nbsp; He then turned back to his elusive carny dream, learning to eat fire, tell fortunes, and volunteering in a knife throwing act.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1962, his health had deteriorated beyond repair, and shortly after going partially blind he was diagnosed with tongue cancer.&nbsp; Diagnosed as terminal, Gresham was alone and dying, never having fulfilled his true dream of becoming a carny.&nbsp; On September 14, 1962 he checked into the Hotel Carter in Manhattan, where he would then commit suice by overdosing on sleeping pills.&nbsp; A writer, magician, and veteran, he was forgotten by New York, with his death only being noted by a single columnist.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Michael Sidorvich was born on July 6, 1916. He grew up and lived in New York City to a Jewish family, both of his parents being immigrants to America. He lived at 341 East 19th St in Gramercy Park, a neighborhood on the south end of Midtown. He attended Seward Park High School for an undetermined number of years, then transferred to Stuyvesant High School, an all-boys technical high school at the time, and underwent engineering training there. During his time at Seward Park, he became acquainted with a man named Julius Rosenberg. In 1934, Sidorovich became a member of the Young Communist League, an organization that taught its members about the ideas of Marx and about the ideology of communism as a whole. Rosenberg also joined the League, and rose to a higher position within the organization, choosing to spread the ideals of communism at home in America, while Sidorovich decided his efforts would be better served abroad.On October 23, 1937, Sidorovich left New York on the Champlain to Spain along with the rest of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, which had been training and fighting for months at that point. He landed in Spain on November 9, fighting in the 4th group, 35th battery of the Brigade, which was the anti-tank division. His division commander was Nathan Budish, an engineer from Minnesota who had served as an artillery officer in the US army reserves. The 35th Battery would see heavy fighting in Teruel, with Earnest Hemmingway himself there to report on it. The division would then fight in the Retreats through Aragon, and end up in Alcoi, a small outpost near Valencia. They saw intense combat defending the Levante Front, and managed to hold off the Nationalists during their offensive. Sidorovich returned to the US on February 4, 1939 aboard the President Harding after Barcelona fell and the war was hopeless. Years later, Sidorovich married Ann Sidorovich, who was a dressmaker and daughter of a Communist Party member Mikhail Tkach, who edited a Ukranian newspaper. The Sidorovichs lived at 10 Monroe Street in Knickerbocker Village, a group of apartments on the Lower East side between the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges, in the same building as his old friend Julius Rosenberg and his wife Ethel. In 1939, Sidorovich and Rosenberg would work at Williams Aeronautical Corporation, a company started by fellow Spanish Civil War veteran Paul Williams.Williams was born in Ohio, and became the only black pilot in the area for himself, had connections to the Soviet government, and became under investigation in the famous Rosenberg Trial, in which Julius and Ethel would be executed.&nbsp;time. After a few failed attempts to design and sell a plane to the government, he went to Spain to see if he could put his talents to work there &ndash; only to be told the army didn&rsquo;t need more pilots. He returned to the US after three months, and began teaching aviation courses under the umbrella of a communist aligned organization called the Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists, and Technicians. Michael and Ann Sidorovich, and Julius Rosenberg, all attended his classes and began working for him. The company, as well as Rosenberg himself.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Saul Wellman is a man who&rsquo;s entire life has been dedicated to revolution. From day one he fought for a better world and in his own words he wanted &ldquo;...things to change, where the playing field is leveled, where equality emerges as a reality...where the horrible things about inequality are eliminated.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWellman&rsquo;s story begins on August 18, 1913, Elizabeth, New Jersey. He was born to a Jewish mother who emigrated from the Russian Empire. His mother was an avid socialist and as Wellman himself put it, &ldquo;I suckled the ideas of socialism at my mother&rsquo;s breast.&rdquo; Shortly after his birth, he and his mother moved to 136 Pulaski Street in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn where Wellman attended Boys High School in Brooklyn. His rapidly developing political consciousness was put into high gear when his mother took him to see Eugene Debs speak when he was 14. From that point on, Saul Wellman&rsquo;s identity as an avid socialist and revolutionary was solidified. However, this was dangerous to be at the time since he grew up in the context of the Palmer raids and the first Red Scare during the 1920&rsquo;s. Wellman saw many of his mother&rsquo;s associates rooted out and arrested by DOJ spies and he himself was arrested when he attended a demonstration of 100,000 workers at Union Square in New York City. This earned him an expulsion from his school and he spent the next few years in limbo. His life found purpose again upon the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Hearing about the abuses of Jews in fascist Germany and the plight of the Popular Front government in Spain, he could not allow himself to stand by. He felt duty bound as a lifelong socialist to prevent the world from falling to fascist tyranny and so on April 28, 1937 he set sail aboard the Normandie, arriving in Spain on May 28, 1937. Being a politically active and knowledgeable individual, he was assigned as adjutant commissar to the Candadian MacKenzie-Papineau Brigade despite being an American himself. Unlike the portrayals of commissars in popular media as detached political bureaucrats who execute dissidents at a whim, the goal of the Republican Commiserate was to be Mother Hens.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Republican army was enthusiastic and patriotic but completely untrained in the ways of war. The commissar was supposed to make up for this and thus had several roles:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Create the spirit of discipline and loyalty to the Republican cause and establish comradery between officers and rank and file<br />\r\n-Be an educator, clarifying all political issues<br />\r\n-Act as a commanding officer during combat and ensure orders were being followed<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWellman fulfilled this role trying to help the material well-being and comfort of his men. He worried about everything from food to sanitation, nagging his superiors to give his men whatever supplies they could give.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWellman found himself in the thick of five major battles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe barely survived being used as a meat shield during Fuentes de Ebro where his brigade was thrown head first into the fascist advance in order to slow it down, muddying the ground with their own blood. Afterwards he took on the role of battalion commissar upon the death of his predecessor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe led his men through the meat grinder of Mas de Las Matas. After this he spent two week chasing down American cigarettes for his men, only to not be given them by the battalion&rsquo;s own inspector general.<br />\r\nWellman strove through the bitter snows of Teruel as it changed hands several times. During the final Republican holdout on El Muleton , he found himself pushed to the limit. Republican forces were on their last legs; they were outgunned, surrounded, stuck on an exposed hill with soil unusable for fortifications. The city below them filled with masses of fascists as Nationalist bombs and artillery blotted out the sun. Wellman ran from position to position as his ears rang from explosions, dust clawed at his throat and every step he took landed in a pool of his comrades&rsquo;s blood. Wherever he could, he led hold out actions, restored machine gun positions and tended to the wounded. Despite Republican valor, the fascist won the battle. This left Wellman to deal with a depleted and demoralized brigade suffering from a lack of supplies. Most notably, the skin of the soldiers started to crack due to a lack of oil so on his own initiative he arranged for several men to take a truck to Andorra and buy some oil. Four days later the men returned. As Wellman himself put it, &ldquo;No words were exchanged except a wink and a red front salute as [they] passed me a handful of nuts to replenish our depleted bodies.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs Wellman chowed down on nuts with his men, he never expected that in just a few days he would find himself fighting in the Retreats. Always running under a hail of fire, never looking back for fear of seeing a Moorish cavalryman behind him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWellman was critically wounded during the failed river crossing of the Ebro river which sealed the fate of the Republic. As fascist victory became inevitable, Wellman found himself on a ship going back to the USA. He arrived on December 20, 1938 aboard the Ausonia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite the failure in Spain, Wellman never gave up. As WWII broke out he signed up for the Army knowing that he must, for a fascist victory now meant fascist victory forever. He joined the ranks of the exalted 101st &ldquo;Screaming Eagles&rdquo; Airborne Division as an automatic rifleman and fought in Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge where he was critically wounded again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUpon returning back to home as a war hero, he got married and moved to Detroit. Here he resumed his political activities. Wellman joined the Communist Party, quickly rising to the top ranks, and took a job as a truck driver where he quickly began unionizing the workers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1949, he learned the hard way that history repeats itself as he was caught up in the Second Red Scare. Wellman was one of the Michigan Six that were tried under the Smith Act. He served six months in prison and broke with the Communist Party after he left as information about Stalin&rsquo;s atrocities reached the rest of the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite this he remained active as the de facto leader of the New-Left movement, having weekly breakfasts with movement figures and protesting wars from Vietnam to Iraq until his death on December 11, 2003.</p>\r\n",

Osheroff&rsquo;s political activism began at the age of twelve when he participated in a protest against the executions of two activists, Nicola Saco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, accused of killing a shoe company paymaster and a guard. At the age of sixteen he joined the Young Communist League, an organization aiming to develop its members into Communists through the study of Marxism and Leninism. A carpenter by trade, Osheroff became a prominent figure in his neighborhood of Brownsville, Brooklyn as a public speaker and for his activist organization of demonstrations and aid in resisting evictions in the neighborhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1931, Osheroff was arrested for moving furniture of evicted families back into their apartments. He was assaulted in prison by fascist-affiliated police officers that called him a &quot;dirty Communist Jew bastard.&quot; &quot;All of which was true,&quot; Osheroff said, &quot;except for the bastard part.&quot; This event inspired Osheroff to officially join the Communist Party. Osheroff occasionally ran into members of the IWW and admired them for their idealism but viewed their cause as hopeless. He graduated from the City College of New York and then went to Pennsylvania and Ohio to organize steel and coal workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Osheroff resisted the call to take up arms in a fight for the Spanish Republic for some time and was content to live in Brownsville with his girlfriend. Finally, newsreel footage of the Nazi Condor Legion terror bombing the Basque city of Guernica convinced him of the importance of fighting for the Republican side. Leaving his girlfriend behind, he sailed for France in May of 1937. Because the French had closed their border with Spain by this time, Osheroff was forced to take a boat from Marseille to Barcelona. Near the Spanish coast, Osheroff&rsquo;s boat was torpedoed by an Italian submarine. Osheroff managed to swim nearly two miles to shore on his own. Although most of the approximately 250 people on the boat had swam to shore or were picked up by anti-war Catalan fishermen, hoping that the submarine would not return to shoot them, approximately 80 of the passengers had drowned. By his account, Oshroff had no military experience before Spain except for hearing a revolver go off when he lived in a neighborhood with gang violence. Nonetheless, he claimed that it is conviction, not experience alone, that makes for a good soldier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abe served as a scout, an infantryman, and a mapmaker with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. He fought in the battles of Qinto Lochita and Fuentes de Ebro. In September of 1937, he fought in the Battle of Belchite near the city of Zaragoza in Aragon. As he tried to save a company of soldiers that had fallen behind in the trenches, machine-gun fire shattered his knee. After his injury, Osheroff returned to base to teach for a short time. He even managed to get into a fistfight with Ernest Hemingway over food Abe admitted he had been stealing from the writer. Narrowly dodging a court-marshalling by his superior officers and sick with typhoid, Osheroff fled to France as Franco&rsquo;s forces closed in. After returning to the US, Osheroff ran as a communist for New York legislature. During the height of the red scare and McCarthyism, he was forced to spend three years in hiding. On the outbreak of World War II, Osheroff enlisted in the army but was barred from going overseas based on his political views. &ldquo;We all volunteered for World War II,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To us, it was the same war [as the Spanish Civil War].&rdquo; Osheroff spent the war training troops in the South. He ultimately left the communist party in 1951 in response to persecution from the House of Un-American Activities and left New York at the same time and moved his family to the West Coast. After the war, he travelled throughout the South working on civil rights causes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He continued to pursue activism throughout his life, going to Nicaragua to construct housing and to the campus of the University of Washington and to meetings across Seattle to rally opponents of the war in Iraq in 2003. He protested the military dictatorships and wars in Vietnam, Guatemala, Indonesia, Chile and Panama. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;ve felt strongly about something, I&rsquo;ve felt a terrible need to do something about it or suffer loss of self respect,&rdquo; said Osheroff regarding his humanitarian work. Osheroff taught at the University of California-Los Angeles and at the University of Washington-Seattle and also traveled to other universities to deliver lectures. He had six children. In 1974, Osheroff made an award winning documentary film called &ldquo;Dreams and Nightmares&rdquo; in which he documented much of his youth and his experiences in Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From his work as a fighter against fascism in Spain, a trainer of troops to fight fascism in the Second World War, a builder of houses in Nicaragua, a protestor of war and dictatorship, a teacher, and a documentary film-maker, Abe Osheroff spent most of his life fighting against injustices wherever he saw them. He died on April 6th, 2008 in his home in Seattle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Tired, parched and hungry they moved on to Hill 666 a rocky height, completely barren of any vegetation due to the repeated bombardment; not enough soil to dig trenches, the parapets piled-up rock that added to the danger when struck by artillery shells.

After graduating high school, Ofsink had aspirations to be a lawyer. He attended St. John&rsquo;s Law and graduated in 1932 after he earned a bachelor of laws degree. He was a practicing lawyer and one of the earliest members of the National Lawyers Guild. He was a legal staff member who worked at the International Labor Defense. Ofsink was a registered member of the Communist Party of New York. He was unmarried and lived alone in a two-story house located at 1035 Hegeman Avenue, Brooklyn NY.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>After almost five years of practicing law, Ofsink decided to fight for the Republic side in the Spanish Civil War. He was determined to fight off the fascists and was one of the many Jews that served in the Abraham Lincoln Battalion. Ofsink was issued a passport on January 5th, 1937. His passport number was 361878. It took him 11 days to arrive in Spain aboard the <em>Paris. </em>He arrived in Spain in February 1937.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ofsink served as part of the land army of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion and was ranked a Teniente, which translates to a lieutenant in English. He served in the Battle of Jarama. While fighting at the Battle of Brunete, Ofsink was severely wounded on July 13th, 1937. He went to train at the Officers Training School at Tarazona. He was discharged from the training school on September 13, 1937. Ofsink was known as very reliable among his comrades and had a good record in Spain. According to his superior&rsquo;s remarks, Ofsink was reliable, disciplined and worked well with other men. He was seen as &ldquo;an extra good&rdquo; political influence among his comrades. Ofsink was reported Missing in Action on April 3rd, 1938 near Gandesa. It is presumed that he died on that day.</p>\r\n    ",

A month later, she helped set up the first American hospital in Romeral. In a letter from July addressed to &quot;T,&quot; she states, &quot;My first operating room was set up in Romeral, and what a problem! No running water; water had to be carried in the house after we had pulled it up from a well, and then was placed in tanks for scrubbing. Water had to be carried in for the autoclaves, etc. Our autoclaves are heated by prima stoves which run on kerosene, and you can&rsquo;t imagine how much work there is attached to sterilizing and keeping things clean. We spend hours trying to figure out a way in which to sterilize our goods so that things come out dry. We have not given up trying although we have been at it five months.&quot; Most of her letters were sent to her family from Spain, and usually depicted detailed descriptions of her work and surroundings. She served throughout Spain, setting up operating rooms in Villa Paz, Teruel, the Aragon Front, Belchite, Gandesa, and Cuevas Labradas. Regarding her experience treating the troops, she once stated, &quot;What right had I to be frightened? I who have just tasted what they have long lived through? With my heart pounding almost as loudly as the roar of the motors aboe, I spoke to them. I told them they must be brave.&quot; These statements were often published in radical papers and helped label the American Medical Brigade members as heroes. Upon her return to the United States in 1938, Taft continued to communicate with individuals in Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a documentary called &quot;Into the Fire: American Women in the Spanish Civil War,&quot; another volunteer named Helen Freeman recalled, &quot;I met some friends and went to a meeting. And the meeting was called to aid Spanish democracy. All the different unions were supporting the group. They asked for nurses and doctors and volunteers to go to Spain. And so, I volunteered. They called us in and started organizing the trip. Meeting with the different people who were going, like Fredericka Martin, Lini DeVries, and my friend Anne Taft, who graduated from the same school that I did. People had to resign from their jobs. Most of us were young nurses. And so, that&rsquo;s why they had meetings to teach the young people what to expect when they get over there.&quot; She was documented to be the head nurse later on in her life and continued similar activities even after returning to New York by serving as a spokesperson for a fundraising drive that sent an American relief ship with food, clothing, and supplies to Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnne Taft married Dr. Leon F. Muldavin in New York City, and remained with him in the city throughout their lives. She passed away in 1990 in New York City.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Paolino Sarti was born on the twenty-first of May, 1908 in S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil. His parents, who were farmers, had been part of the wave of Italians who immigrated to Brazil in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His mother died when he was young, and his older sister moved away shortly afterwards to get married, so Sarti grew up without a mother figure. His family moved back to Italy after he was born, and that is where his childhood took place.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the age of 18, in the city of Genoa in Northern Italy, Sarti boarded the SS Conte Biancamano, bound for New York City. He arrived on the 11th of March, 1927, declaring intentions of establishing permanent residence and citizenship. His final destination was Chicago, Illinois. During his time in Chicago, he picked up English, as well as a job in a stationery factory.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1931 in the midst of the Great Depression, Sarti&rsquo;s workmate was to be fired. Sarti volunteered himself in his place out of altruism--his workmate had a family and he did not. Following the loss of his job, Sarti moved to New York City in search of better prospects. He was unemployed for six to seven months, and was forced to sleep on park benches and in subway cars. Eventually, he was able to secure a job as a waiter, and moved into an apartment in Greenwich Village. But Sarti was deeply disaffected by his experiences with unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, and was drawn towards leftist political groups and unions, including the International Workers Order, Italian Workers&rsquo; Club, and Friends of the Soviet Union. In 1934, he joined the Communist Party USA, a Comintern-affiliated group based in New York City. He was active in the party, selling their paper, the <em>Daily Worker</em>, on the street, &ldquo;breaking up a fascist reception,&rdquo; and participating in street demonstrations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1937, feeling a sense of moral duty, Paolino Sarti made the decision to travel to Spain. With a false Spanish passport, a nom de guerre, &ldquo;Paulino Sala Perez,&rdquo; and help from the Italian Communist Party bureau, he arrived in Albacete on October 22nd. He had travelled by steamship and railroad. He cited his reason for making the journey and facing the possibility of ultimate sacrifice as simply &ldquo;to fight against fascism.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sarti joined the 1st Company of the Lincoln Battalion. He served at the front in Teruel and then in Seguro de los Ba&ntilde;os, a small village to the north, from January 1st of 1938 (about two weeks after the battle began) until February 15th of the same year, when he was wounded in the leg while advancing on a fortified Nationalist position, becoming one of the 85,000 casualties at that brutal battle. After being injured, Sarti was flown to the Red Cross base in Catalonia for treatment. After surgery and recovery, he was declared no longer fit for active military service, and was reassigned as brigade guard. Throughout his time in Spain, Paolino Sarti received overwhelmingly positive reports from his commanders. He was called &ldquo;of the best&#39;&#39;, &ldquo;disciplined, steady, brave&rdquo;, and &ldquo;a very good antifascist.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In late October 1938, as the war neared its end and the inevitability of a Nationalist victory became clearer, Sarti began expressing a desire to be repatriated to the United States. Although the US government did not have knowledge of his membership to the Communist Party, he was concerned that he would be unable to return because of his having assumed an alias. It is unclear exactly how he got back to the United States, but upon arrival he returned to his apartment at 349 West 4th St and his job as a waiter. Two years later, on the 17th of October, 1940, he and Yolanda Moriconi were married.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once all the information about the Americans who had illegally travelled to Spain came out, Sarti became acutely aware of the possibility of being deported. To ensure this didn&rsquo;t happen, he enlisted in the Navy during World War II, serving on the USS Alaska, and receiving praise for his conduct once again. Sarti had a child, Bob, who was born while he was still serving in the war.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite his incredible accomplishments, service, activism, and strong convictions, Paolino Sarti did not speak of politics at home. In fact, he kept Spain a secret, including from his children. This was due to the widespread (but not misplaced) fear that characterized the McCarthy Era, and the very strong implications of Sarti&rsquo;s time in Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his life after the Spanish Civil War, there were two things that were most important to Paolino Sarti: family and education. Despite the fact that he had not been formally educated past primary school, it was never even a question that his son would go to college (he did).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paolino Sarti, who loved gardens, pinochle, Chesterfields, and anti-fascism, died on November 28th, 1956, and is buried in the Long Island National Cemetery.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Robert Haslan was born in New York City on May 25, 1915. He had a relatively small family and grew up in an apartment in Upper Manhattan at 25 Fort Washington Avenue with his father, Paul Haslan, brother, William Haslan, and mother (name unknown). Prior to deciding to volunteer for the war, Haslan had recently finished high school and was beginning to study art at a night school that was offering lessons in a nearby neighborhood. For income, he had been working on-and-off since he was 14&mdash;mostly odd jobs like clerical work and serving at cafes&mdash;and had also pursued a side career as an artist. Additionally, Haslan spent a year and a half with the Works Progress Administration (WPA). The WPA was one of the New Deal agencies created during the Second New Deal that provided paid jobs in sectors like infrastructure to the unemployed during the Great Depression. Through the WPA, Haslan became a part of the City Projects Council and had also joined the Workers Alliance of America (WAA).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The WAA had opened Haslan up to a lot more Communist ideas as he felt himself sympathizing with fellow members and frequently participating in the labor movement that was going on at the time in New York City. He then joined the Communist party in November of 1936&mdash;a decision which likely influenced his perspective towards the political atmosphere overseas and spurred him to volunteer for the war when time came.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He received his passport on June 29, 1937, and shortly left for Spain aboard the President Roosevelt ship on July 7, 1937. However, partially because of the U.S. government&rsquo;s adamant neutrality regarding the war, the President Roosevelt couldn&rsquo;t take the volunteers straight to Spain. After an 8 day journey across the Atlantic, Haslan arrived in Havre, France on July 15th, where he then boarded the Espolla&mdash;the ship that would bring him and 50 other men across the border&mdash;and arrived in Spain on July 24th. During this time, he often assumed the alias&rsquo; &ldquo;Bob Haslan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Robert Haslam&rdquo; in records like lists and letters for confidentiality purposes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once he got situated, Haslan spent about six weeks training with a very diverse unit in the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion alongside international volunteers from countries like Belgium, Canada, France, Poland, Italy, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. He was then transferred out from the training base in Tarazona to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in November 1937 before being put into action on the Aragon and Tereul fronts with the Lincoln-Washington Battalion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whilst fighting at the Teruel front, Haslan had bruised his knee and&mdash;he claimed this was mainly due to the dampness of the environment&mdash;it had become swollen and inflamed. Too painful to continue, he was sent to the hospital to have it cut open. Haslan was quick to mention in a letter written on March 2, 1938 from Albacete to a friend back home that it had healed relatively quickly and he was hoping &ldquo;to be rejoining the battalion soon.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For better or worse, Haslan soon got what he hoped for as he was put back on the frontlines during the Aragon Offensive&mdash;a military campaign focused on defeating the Republican troops in that area (which were weakened from the Battle of Teruel). Nationalists who advanced from the north with the Army of Africa, flanked by the Condor Legion as well 47 artillery batteries, easily held the upper hand against the already-depleted Republican troops. The battalion was then forced to abandon their positions during what is known as the Retreats, where Haslan unfortunately, was killed in action on April 4, 1938.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though he died early in the war, there is no doubt that Haslan deeply valued his time in Spain, writing in a letter that he went &ldquo;through good experiences here, experiences which are difficult to relate or describe, but they do take their place in the development of one&#39;s character and understanding.&rdquo; When asked in a questionnaire what the most outstanding thing he had experienced since leaving the U.S. was, Haslan marvelled at the experience of &ldquo;being able to take part in the high political awareness of the people of Spain,&rdquo; because &ldquo; they unite for progress and against racism and fascism. &ldquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through what little he left behind, Haslan has made his values evident. He held an &ldquo;undying hatred for fascism&rdquo; and had gone to Spain as a Communist willing to lay his life down to stop its spread. Perhaps more unexpectedly, Haslan had also developed an affinity for the country and the camaraderie it united in the process. Had he survived, Haslan intended to remain in Spain indefinitely and continue his art studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>William Allen Van der Roest was born in Canada in 1913. At some point in his life, he came to live in New York City (specifically, 228 West 111th Street in Harlem), and at the age of 24, he decided to enlist to go fight in Spain. After obtaining a passport on March 29, 1937, he left New York aboard the Aquitania (an ocean liner that was sailing from New York to Cherbourg and Southampton) just 2 days later. Following his arrival in Spain (presumably coming from Cherbourg along with several other volunteers who also departed New York aboard the Aquitania on March 31st) in April, he eventually became the secretary of his company within the Lincoln Battalion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn July 6th, 1937, the Lincoln, Washington, and British Battalions were sent to serve as part of the offensive at Brunete against the Nationalists. They were sent to capture the town of Villanueva de la Ca&ntilde;ada and ended up spending the entire day engaged in a brutal struggle that was ultimately inconclusive. They were sent back to break the stalemate at the town the next day, and although they did manage to take the town, they suffered heavy casualties. Among those casualties was Van der Roest, who was killed during an attack by Nationalist aircraft. His demise was personally witnessed by Carl Syvanen, a fellow member of the Lincoln Battalion who would go on to recount the story in the Finnish novel Meid&auml;n Poikamme Espanjassa (Our Boys in Spain).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInterestingly enough, Van der Roest is claimed as a member of both the Lincoln Battalion and the Canadian-centric Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion: he was killed before ever getting the chance to join the &quot;Mac-Paps&quot; (as Syvanen later would) but is still listed among those Canadians who gave their life in service of the Republic (it is unclear whether or not he would have wanted to be remembered as a Canadian or an American, but his hometown is still remembered as New York).</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Clara Leight was born March 10, 1900 in Russia. She moved to the United States when she was nine years old as a Russian-Jewish immigrant. It is unclear how she lost her father, but Leight was raised only by her mother and grew up hearing Yiddish folktales from a book dating all the way back to the 16th century. Her mother used these stories to encourage compassion towards others in their community. Leight&rsquo;s family was filled with suffragists and labor organizers. They inspired her to fight for what she believed in and to support different causes. When Leight got older, she used what her mother had taught her and studied to become a nurse at Bellevue Hospital. She successfully graduated in 1927. Leight got her passport on May 4, 1934 so that she could serve in the Spanish Civil War. She became a nurse in the army in March of 1937 after she sailed aboard Ile de France. Her family supported Leight&lsquo;s decision when she volunteered. In fact, she received much support and encouragement from her loved ones back at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nWhen Leight was in the army, she was single, and her address was 531 East 84th Street in New York. She served with the Republican Medical Services at Villa Paz hospital. Leight was also part of the American Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy (AMBASD). As a nurse in the war, she served as an interpreter and colleague to a nurse named Margaret Sanger. As they visited hospitals and clinics in the Soviet Union, Leight remarked how condoms and other such things were not allowed to be distributed by Sanger. She noticed the backward ways of the place she was born in. Leight came from a background of suffragists, so she understood the sexism displayed in those actions. Eventually, she was promoted to first lieutenant in the Federal Government Nursing service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nLeight returned home in August, 1937 aboard the Queen Mary. Despite serving in the war, and supporting her country once, she later served in the army as a nurse once again for the US in World War II, from February 3, 1943 to December 20, 1945. Leight&rsquo;s determination to support causes she believed in and serve her home continues to inspire many, even today. Leight passed away on March 17, 1987 from natural causes.</p>\r\n",

He attended public school in China where basic military training was provided before immigrating to the United States at around 20 years old to work. Like most immigrants, he may have left China for more opportunities. He lived at 258 W. 55th Street on the Upper West Side working as both a waiter and a cook. From there, he joined the Spanish Civil War on June 12, 1937 and served with the XV BDE (the Abraham Lincoln Brigade). It&rsquo;s likely he took part in the war because he was a Communist, and believed in the Republic&rsquo;s cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter joining the war, he realized that there weren&rsquo;t many Chinese soldiers. He has seen only eight other Chinese soldiers, and none of them were in his squad. In a letter to another soldier, he says he wished he had someone to talk to in Chinese. For a lot of Chinese soldiers who volunteered to fight, they believed in the saying &ldquo;\u56db\u6d77\u4e00\u5bb6&rdquo; which directly translate to &ldquo;four seas one family,&rdquo; that something on the other side of the world was also something that he can be and is part of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn September 1937, there was one account of him getting injured mentioned in the La Vanguardia, a Spanish daily newspaper. Yick was shot in the right foot and through his toe and went to a hospital in Benicassim. After removing his big toe, he said he was determined to go right back to the battlefield and join the front lines. He went missing in the battle of Gandesa, and was assumed dead on April 3, 1938 at the age of 24.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter his death, surviving soldiers say they don&rsquo;t know Yick&rsquo;s real name, or where he was from, but remembered that he spoke fluent English, suggesting that he may have been from New York City. An investigator later asked around in Chinatown, NYC before finding an elderly man who says he recognized Yick. Once the elderly man was shown a picture of the soldier, he was sure that the soldier was Chen Wenrao from Guangzhou, confirming the soldier&rsquo;s real name and background.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Jerry Weinberg (also known as Gerald Weinberg and Jerry Warren) was a Jewish orphan whose date of birth is unknown. He also had a sister named Estelle. He went to Brooklyn College for a year before going off to Spain to fight in the Spanish Civil War. He fought as a member of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade against the fascist forces of General Francesco Franco and the Nationalists on February 6th, 1937. He received his passport on February 2nd, 1937, which revealed that he was 23 years old and lived in Brooklyn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAs a member of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, he was present when Oliver Law (the first black commander of an American Military Unit) died at the battle for Mosquito Ridge. As Law recklessly charged towards the heavily fortified fascists, he was gunned down almost instantly. Weinberg crawled to Law, pulling him to safety, and removed Law&rsquo;s boots from his feet. However, Law died less than an hour later, according to fellow Brigade member Harry Fisher. Law&rsquo;s death, however, is subject to controversy. One story claims that he died from enemy fire (the official story). The other (an unofficial story told by William Herrick, another Brigade member) states that he was shot by a black Brigade member who thought Law was behaving recklessly and endangered the brigade. He then paints Jerry as a looter who stole Law&rsquo;s belt and boots after slashing the aforementioned boots. However, it is widely agreed that Herrick&rsquo;s story was a lie, despite the fringe groups who believe it to be the truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter the Spanish Civil War, Weinberg became a bombardier on a B-24 Bomber in World War II. As a bombardier, he earned a Distinguished Flying Cross for participating in the Bombing Raids of Ploesti Oil Fields in Romania. Weinberg said that the action &ldquo;made up for&rdquo; Spain, alluding to how the Brigade and the left failed to prevent the rise of Francesco Franco and his Nationalists in Spain. During the Ploesti Oil Field Raids, rather than landing in neutral Turkey and staying in safe detention, he instead chose to escape by flying over Egypt, reaching England and so that he may continue to fight as a bombardier. Sadly this is where his story ends, when October 30th, 1943, he died flying over Germany.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Rebecca Durem Schulman was born in Dayton, Ohio&mdash;an industrial town considered the &ldquo;birthplace of aviation&rdquo;&mdash; on January 8th, 1911. She was a Russian-American Jew; when she was 4 years old, her mother took her to visit her grandmother in Russia. The visit was unfortunately timed, as the raging revolution occurring in Russia at the time trapped the Schulmans in Russia for four years, during which Schulman&rsquo;s father sent his wife and daughter money to keep them alive. After she and her mother returned from Russia, the Schulman family settled in Brooklyn, New York, on 2168 77th Street (a part of Bensonhurst). Graduating from nursing school in 1931, Schulman served as both a private and a hospital nurse. At Beth Israel hospital in midtown Manhattan, which was founded 40 years earlier to serve Jewish immigrants, Schulman worked with Dr. Edward Barsky, an organizer for medical services in Spain. Dr. Barsky made Schulman aware of Spain&rsquo;s need for medical resources and personnel. Although, in an interview years after the Spanish Civil War, Schulman said she was never &quot;very political,&quot; she believed in Spain&rsquo;s right to a democratically elected government. When Dr. Barksy asked her to work in Spain, a &ldquo;restless, adventurous,&rdquo;travel-eager, twenty-six-year-old Schulman said &ldquo;yes, because they needed nurses and [she wanted] to help right a wrong.&rdquo; While serving at Villa Paz, the American Base&rsquo;s Hospital in Saelices, Schulman met Abraham Lincoln Brigade volunteer Ramon Durem, who was recuperating from a leg wound. Durem was a notable poet; Schulam married him in Aranjuez on March 17th, 1938. After Republican armies were forced to retreat from Villa Paz after an aerial bombing of nearby Urrea de Ga&eacute;n, Schulman was transported to Barcelona by train. On May 11, 1938, she returned to Brooklyn aboard the Normandie due to pregnancy. Reflecting on her experience in the war, Schulman said &quot;I blossomed in Spain. Everyone was your Camarada. We were all together.&rdquo;<br />\r\nSchulman died on August 17, 2002, in Claremont, California at the age of 91. She is survived by three daughters, Dolores&mdash;the daughter she gave birth to after returning from Spain and named after Dolores Ibarruri&mdash;Pilar and Vita, four grandchildren, five great-grandchildren, and one great-great-grandchild.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Edna Drabkin Romer was a young, Jewish member of the Socialist party when she enlisted to serve as a nurse in the Spanish Civil War. She and her husband, both self-acclaimed working people, made the journey from New York City to Spain on July 18th, 1937. Upon arrival, her husband immediately headed to the front lines. With credentials and training from the Metropolitan Hospital of New York, Edna worked as a nurse for the American Medical Bureau. She aided the injured and saved lives in the American Hospital, situated in the Palace of Villa Paz in Saelices, Cuenca, as well as with the Auto-Chir on the Aragon Front, the 35th Division on the Teruel Front, and in field hospitals along the Ebro River.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>She described her duties as meaningful, but less than glamorous in letters to her friends in the States. The weather was harsh, often calling for layers of sweaters and sheepskin jackets to ward off the cold. She and her friends used their breaks &ndash; on the rare occasion they could get one &ndash; to search for a water bottle they could heat, but even then they had no fuel to keep a fire. Through it all,&nbsp; even with ten to fifteen hour shifts and constant stress, she found value in the work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The hospital held what she called &ldquo;fiestas,&rdquo; inviting in Spanish peasant farmers, or campesinos, to drink, dance, eat, and listen to political speeches. There were posters for the cause on every wall, games like chess and checkers if they could find the time, and a library with not nearly enough intellectual books to be read.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Romer especially loved the people and the culture. She treated mostly French and Spanish soldiers, who she thought were short-tempered, but always showed mettle. French, Spanish, and the occasional German became required communication skills, and she relished the moments she found to speak English to a fellow nurse or a soldier seeking medical attention.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>When interactions with soldiers and the Medical Bureau&rsquo;s subpar library failed to satisfy her intellectually, she would wait for a visit from someone who could. Ralph Bates, Ernest Hemingway, Martha Gelhorn, Dorothy Parker, and Alan Campbell all visited field hospitals where she served, touring the grounds and offering news about the world outside Spain. Romer even spoke to US Congressmen John Bernard of the Farmer-Labor Party and Jerry Joseph O&rsquo;Connell of the Democratic Party. They gave speeches about FDR&rsquo;s Neutrality Act, calling for it to be overturned as the beginning of an effort to establish a classless society in Spain. Romer thought they were sincere and revolutionary.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In 1937, right in the thick of the war, she wrote a letter home asking for news about the New York elections. The Nationalists had gained most of the Basque region and were pushing Republican forces further towards the Ebro, and Romer wanted to know about Socialist Harry W. Laidler&rsquo;s progress in his run for Governor of New York. She asked whether the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) was still going strong, and whether the Socialist party had gained any traction nationally in the United States. This was her cause.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Her husband, Samuel Romer, served with her, though he was captured by nationalists and spent seven months in a prison camp before being released in exchange for Italian soldiers. After he returned from Spain, he wrote about his experience in a 1938 edition of <em>The Socialist Review</em>, where he described himself and Edna as genuine socialists, whose hearts demanded that they fight in Spain. He said they had no regrets.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Despite the grueling work she performed during the war and her dedication to the Socialist cause, Romer was repatriated to the States fourteen months after arriving. Her superiors thought her insufficiently devoted to the cause of the Popular Front government. They worried she would be vulnerable to enemy subversion because she lacked passion and resolve.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>She returned to the U.S. aboard the Normandie on September 26th, 1938. One of her deepest regrets was not chronicling her time in Spain. After her husband&rsquo;s sudden heart attack in 1965, she held memories of their efforts in Spain close to her heart. Romer passed away at the age of 66 in 1979 and was buried in Florida.</p>\r\n    ",

        "data": "<p>Harry Blum (Kline) was born on December 5th or 6th, 1916 in New York. He attended school through Junior High and became a salesman afterwards. He had two listed addresses: 143 East 16th Street (or 145 East 16th St) in Gramercy Park, and 36 Lewis Street on the Lower East Side, both NYC. With many other young Jewish workers at the time, Blum became a member of the YCL in November 1936 and joined the volunteers to fight for the Republic in Spain a year later, receiving his passport in April 1937. He sailed on May 1, 1937 aboard the Britannic, taking the route from New York to London, and arrived in Spain on the 25th of May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn Spain, Blum fought for the Mackenzie&ndash;Papineau Battalion (Mac-Paps), the Canadian branch of the XV International (Abraham Lincoln) Brigade. Even though the Mac-Paps were nominally Canadian, the battalion was initially made up of more volunteers from the United States than from Canada. He was one of approximately 1,250 Jewish volunteers from the US, which made up 38% of the total. The Jewish volunteers went into Spain to fight for their sense of justice as much as they did for socialism or communism or against fascism. In the 1940s however, the Stalinist opposition to Zionism led to discrimmination against Jewish vertans by the Left and a minimization of their role in the war. As such, much of the information on Jewish volunteers was not maintained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBlum also faced discrimmination, this time for having supported Communism and fighting in the Spanish Civil War, when he and nearly 500 other Abraham Lincoln Brigade veterans enlisted to serve in WWII. With his fellow veterans, Blum wrote against the apparent policy that prohibited those that had volunteered in Spain from receiving promotions or participating in active service. Letters from more than 70 veterans, including some written by Blum and Jack Bjoze, VALB Executive Secretary, document examples of discrimination and discuss means of exposing this policy to the media and putting an end to it. Blum survived WWII and died in March 1974.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Milton &ldquo;Milt&rdquo; Wolff was born on October 8th, 1915, to a Jewish family in Brooklyn. His parents were Yiddish-speaking immigrants from Hungary and Lithuania who made their home in the vicinity of Bay Parkway and Kings Highway. While he lived in Brooklyn, he first resided at 1628 West 5th Street, and later at 74 Quentin Road. He was born into the Great Depression, and he dropped out of the (long-defunct and seemingly obscure) New York School of Commercial Art at age 15 after only a single semester. Wolff then joined the Civilian Conservation Corps, where he was transformed from a shiftless urban teen into a forester. He loved the exercise and the sense of camaraderie between his fellow members, and he was trained in first aid. But eventually, his rosy perspective soured as he witnessed institutional bureaucratism and red tape lead to unsafe working conditions which resulted in the death of one of his friends. He began protesting the CCC&rsquo;s management and conditions, and for this he was expelled. It was during this time that his political consciousness and penchant for organized resistance against oppression began to take shape.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter bouncing around Brooklyn with his friends for a while, he found work at a hat factory in Manhattan&rsquo;s Garment District. Following many colleagues in his social circle, he joined the Young Communists League in April of 1936. Wolff described his political development at the time as &ldquo;rudimentary&rdquo;. Yet by February 20th, 1937, he had set sail for Spain when a YCL organizer asked for volunteers. He told his mother that he was sailing over so he could work in a Spanish factory to free up manpower for the armed workers&rsquo; movement. He secured passage on the Ile de France, and sailed from New York to France. By March 7th, 1937, he had crossed the Pyrenees and reached Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDrawing from his earlier CCC experience, Wolff started out as a medic, and his initial work consisted of carrying water and stretchers. He initially considered himself a pacifist. However, he was soon inspired by the African-American commander of a machine gun unit, and he soon petitioned to serve in a machine gun company. As part of the Washington battalion, he first saw action at Brunete where he narrowly avoided death even while he saw men inches away from him brutally gunned down.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter this engagement, Wolff went on leave in Madrid. During this time, his captain pointed him towards the Cafe Chicote where he first met Ernest Hemingway. Wolff first met Hemingway after seducing his mistress. Hemingway supposedly did not mind this, but he was far more offended when he learned that Wolff had no idea who he was. Initially, Wolff wrote to a friend that Hemingway was &quot;childish in many respects&quot; and that he &quot;want[ed] very much to be a martyr&quot;. He summed up his first thoughts on Hemingway with a quip: &quot;So much for writers. I&#39;d much rather read their works than be with them.&quot; In 1940, when Hemingway published For Whom the Bell Tolls, Wolff later resented his depiction of Republican-sympathizing villagers killing fascists as he thought it overly murderous and bloodthirsty.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter returning from leave, he fought on the Aragon front leading a section of the machine gun company. After performing valiantly despite major losses at Belchite and Quinto, he commanded the machine gun company at Fuentes de Ebro. By January 1938, after not even a single full year in action, he achieved the rank of captain. Wolff drew comparisons to Abraham Lincoln himself, due to his tall and gaunt physique as well as his personal gravitas and strong leadership skills. That March, the base HQ was bombed and the leadership slaughtered. It was at this point that Wolff became the commander. He was preceded by 4 commanders KIA and another 4 seriously wounded. He directed what remained of the battalion through a treacherous retreat from deep behind what had become enemy lines, and traveled alone for six days to the Ebro where he swam across. While rebuilding the battalion as its newly minted commander, he was immortalized in Hemingway&#39;s 1938 Spanish Portraits journalistic series of press vignettes on fighters for the Republican cause. A famous photo of Wolff and Hemingway, taken by photojournalist Robert Capra, was included in the article. A few weeks later, this photograph found its way into the Yiddish newspapers where his mother was alerted to the true nature of his activity in Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the summer of 1938, Wolff led the consolidated Lincoln-Washington battalion back across the Ebro where they held the lines at Hill 666 and held off the fall of Valencia until the Republic ordered the withdrawal of foreign troops later that year. In a ceremonial transfer of authority, Wolff ultimately attained the rank of Major in the Republican Army. By December 15th, 1938, Wolff and the last volunteers made it back to New York City, where Wolff laid a wreath to honor the dead outside Madison Square Park.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter returning to America, Wolff continued a life of service and activism in the name of communism and anti-fascism. Wolff was a beloved figure in Spain, where he returned to visit multiple times. He reminded Spaniards that if they got into trouble in the future, to &ldquo;give me a call&rdquo;. Even after the war&rsquo;s official end, he led street protests in New York City urging the government to lift the Spanish embargo and aid Spanish refugees trapped in neighboring France who were held in what amounted to concentration camps. France threatened to deport the refugees back to Francoist Spain, where they would be treated as enemies of the state and likely tortured or executed. Wolff and other veterans protested outside the French consulate in 1940, and Wolff served 15 days in jail for his activities. He never gave up the fight to free Spain. Wolff was an active member of the U.S. Committee for a Democratic Spain for decades, where he lobbied against political recognition of and treaties with the Franco regime, provided aid to political prisoners and their families, and pushed for democratic reforms. During WWII he was turned down for combat duty due to concerns over his leftist politics, so instead he served with the Office of Strategic Services (which would later become the CIA).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrough a friend of a friend from the war, Wolff came into contact with William Donovan who was selected by President Roosevelt to head the OSS. He assisted Donovan with a project to recruit Spanish Civil War veterans into the British intelligence apparatus. This project began in Spring of 1941 and continued until Pearl Harbor. Then, Wolff directly offered Roosevelt the services of the VALB to the American war effort. This was declined, so Wolff continued recruiting veterans for secret projects in Italy, North Africa, and Normandy. Wolff officially enlisted in 1942, but was quickly marginalized and denied the opportunity to participate in a combat role. He was denied the opportunity to attend Officer Candidate School. In order to try and get a transfer, Wolff then traveled to Burma where he helped the war effort in the Pacific Theater. The OSS then sent him back to Italy where he formed an underground communist partisan network with the help of multiple other Lincoln veterans he had previously embedded. Wolff graduated from parachuting school, which he considered to be one his proudest achievements. He was sent by air into southern France on a top secret mission, but while he was there, he discovered an underground network of Spanish resistance members plotting to invade Spain and overthrow Franco. When Wolff petitioned the OSS to aid them, he was prematurely recalled from his assignment and sent back to America.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrough his stature in the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) he remained a prominent advocate for Spanish Civil War veterans and the causes they espoused. During the Cold War he was the public face of the VALB, where he and Moe Fishman presided over the defense of the Lincoln veterans before the Subversive Activities Control Board in 1954. He and many fellow veterans from New York were lifelong Brooklyn Dodgers fans, and they pushed for integration in the MLB by publicly supporting the inclusion of Jackie Robinson and other black players. He led protests against the Vietnam War and even personally offered Ho Chi Minh VALB military support during their conflict against South Vietnam, which was politely declined. He championed removal of the Cuban embargo, and to this end he helped provide medical aid to a children&rsquo;s hospital in Havana. During the 80s, he and the VALB sent ambulances to the Sandistinas as the Reagan government was funding the anticommunist insurgency.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilton Wolff passed away on January 14th, 2008 at the age of 92 due to congestive heart failure. He is survived by his two children, Susan and Peter, from his first marriage with Anne Gondos. Additionally, he has at least four grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Herman (or Hy, as he was called by his friends, which was short for Hyman) Hollander was born on the 14th of May, 1914 in the city of Lemberg (modern day Lw&oacute;w), Poland. While he was ethnically Polish, the brief years that he spent in that city did not define him. Even during the sunset of his life&mdash;spent in Sunrise, Florida&mdash;he identified as a proud and true New Yorker, specifically from his beloved Lower East Side. It was in this neighborhood that he began his political journey, met his lifelong friends and comrades, and found the fire and determination to be a fighter for his beliefs regardless of age.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hy&#39;s early childhood was marked by an intrusive and disruptive disparity between the different spheres of his life. During his time in Poland, he can remember his grandmother telling him that, &quot;the revolutionaries are in town,&quot; in reference to the Bolsheviks. These loaded words, and the bodies hanging from the gallows that accompanied them flew over Hy&#39;s 6 year old head, but left him asking questions. These sights of tragedy followed Hy and his father even after their move to the States in 1920 after the death of Hy&#39;s mother. They were driven by this tragedy, the prevalent discrminiation towards Jews in Poland, and the promise of a better life. While Hy and his father did move into an ethnically diverse Williamsburg that accepted them, they could not escape poverty&#39;s grasp. One of the defining images from Hy&#39;s childhood that would go on to influence him for the rest of his life was of people in his neighborhood scrounging through barrels and garbage pails for food during the early 30s. Before those teenage years, Hy had always asked why things like war and hunger had to exist, but after his maturation, he was suddenly driven by the horrific images of his past to act. To help. To do his part.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hy was an excellent student, but often found the schoolroom itself lacking for mental stimulation. This would lead him to the Brooklyn Public Library, where he would spend hours reading about his passions&mdash;history and geography&mdash;and the world&#39;s great revolutions. After his visits to the library, he would hear a monthly speaker that would appear on the corner of Varet Street and Graham Avenue near his neighborhood. This man discussed Soviet Russia and its tenets: peace, bread, employment, and equality. Through this speaker, Hy joined the Youth Branch of the Downtown Workers&#39; Club, which finally led him to the Youth Communist League, or YCL. Herman eventually rose to become the President of the Youth Section, and provided food and shelter to the homeless and disadvantaged youths, regardless of the police&#39;s frequent attempts to disrupt him and his friends. He participated in demonstrations for unemployment insurance and for food aid. This ragtag group of YCL boys were beaten by the police, but none of them cared. For them, the League wasn&#39;t as much about a political ideology as it was about helping people, and doing the right thing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was out of this burning conviction that Herman found the need to go to Spain. He hated what Hitler was saying, and was also able to sympathize with the victims of Pogroms and Concentration Camps. He feared that if Hitler wasn&#39;t stopped in Europe, &quot;then instead of Normandy, there would be fighting in Coney Island and Brighton Beach.&quot; Hy felt that he was bound to his duty because he was a member of the human race, and because he believed in a government without oppression that was controlled by the people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After an 11-day voyage aboard the German ocean-liner <em>Berengaria</em>, during which he had his 23rd birthday, Hy disembarked at the Hague and made his way to Paris. After a series of train rides and nighttime walks through villages, he crossed the Pyreenees. After their descent, and arrival in Spain, he and his troupe were greeted by the locals with hospitality and&mdash;more importantly&mdash;wine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hy&#39;s tour in Spain lasted for 14 months, during which he served in the Jarama Valley, Bruneti, Teruel, Albacete, and others. He said himself that being in battle felt like, &quot;the world was coming to an end.&quot; The noise was beyond anything that he had ever experienced, and the sight of what he called the &quot;Lower East Side Boys&quot; being felled beside him was often too much to bear. Two major anecdotes stand out when it comes to his time on the battlefield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first reflects the closeness of the Lincolns, both on the field and off. A man named Jack Weiss, who was Herman&#39;s cousin, served with Herman during the Bruneti campaign. He was injured in the field and was being dragged back behind the lines on a litter, bleeding profusely. He happened to pass by Herman, and when he saw him, Jack shook his fist at Hy as best he could and said, &quot;if you tell my sister that I was wounded then I&#39;ll get even with you.&quot; Herman responded by calling the man crazy, and told him to get some rest while chuckling. Jack fortunately made a recovery from his injury, albeit with a bad leg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second was tragically all too commonplace. A friend of Hy&#39;s, named Sauly Bernbaum, was a Captain in the John Brown Battery. Sauly was greatly admired by Hy, particularly his sense of duty and responsibility as a leader, and the extent to which he acted on these convictions. Sauly never ran away, and never put himself first. The two men served together during the Belchite campaign, which was characterized by the vicious covering fire of Nationalist snipers to slow the Lincolns&#39; advance. During one such push, the group had to run through open ground, and one of their comrades was shot. He was still alive, but could no longer run with the company. Sauly, out of a sense of compassion or duty or both, turned and tried to help the fallen man. In vain he pulled at the near-deadweight, hoping against hope that this man, his friend, would not be left in no-man&#39;s land under withering fire. His fellows, Hy among them, looked on in pain for a moment, before one broke the silence and simply said, &quot;you have to go on.&quot; This is a phrase that Herman would never forget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would stay burned in his mind for years to come, and after once again serving the US in the Second World War as a member of Signal Radio Intelligence, it would shape his career choices. Herman became a leader in movements for various unions in New York City, chief among them being a union for Taxi drivers, which began in 1949. He worked with notables such as Harry Van Arsdale, and got Lincoln Veterans jobs by collaborating with Moe Fishman, the General Secretary of the Brigade&#39;s Veterans&#39; Association. After moving to Florida because of his wife&#39;s health, he joined the National Council of Senior Citizens, and continued to do good work for the community into his own seniority.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Herman Hollander lived an amazing, full life. He rose out of a poor, first-generation immigrant family of Polish Jews to become somebody who made a great difference. He didn&#39;t die a wealthy or famous man, but Herman possessed something that few do. He was proud of his life&#39;s work, and had truly done his part. When asked what he thought about the Spanish Civil War and its effect on his life, he said, &quot;There&#39;s no doubt about it in my mind, and in my heart, what I did 50 years ago is the most beautiful thing that any human being could do. It was a just cause, it was the right thing to do.&quot; He put his life on the line for what he believed in, and helped a cause that would, finally in 1975, bear fruit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Herman was able to see a democratic Spain, and made a trip there in 1986. Amidst all the talks he attended and the gifts he was given, one moment stood out to him as perhaps the best moment of his life. One day during the trip, he and some other veterans saw a protest of mostly young Spanish people moving past the outside of their hotel. The elderly men raised their arms in the Republican Salute, and to their surprise and satisfaction (in Herman&#39;s words) &quot;got it right back.&quot;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>John Gates was born in 1913. A New York City native, he was Jewish with Polish ancestry.&nbsp; He had a brother and three sisters. Throughout his childhood, his father owned and operated small businesses. After graduating from DeWitt Clinton high school, Gates attended City College where his life changed forever after he came across Marx&rsquo;s writing.&nbsp; That discovery led to Gates dropping out of college at age 17 and joining the Communist Party. Then he eventually became a community organizer for unemployed Ohio youth and ran for Youngstown City Council.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When running for the Youngstown City Council, Gates was jailed for causing public disturbances. This was one of the several in his life he was arrested. He was later jailed in New Castle Pennsylvania in 1935 for distributing pamphlets. This was a difficult time for Gates; while being arrested for fighting for what he believed in, the Great Depression made it almost impossible to find a job and forced him to resort to living on public assistance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In early 1937 Gates joined the International Brigade for Spanish Civil War, like many involved in the Communist Party. As a soldier under the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, he was a commisar at age 24, the highest ranking American in the Spanish Civil War. He was an extremely strict battalion commissar. Gates even executed some of his comrades on grounds of desertion. This earned him the hatred and anger of his subordinates. However, he showcased his stamina and bravery by fighting in nearly every single battle throughout the war.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the war, Gates became a secretary for the organization &ldquo;Friends of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade&rdquo; and director of the Young Communist League in New York State. He would eventually become the editor in chief of the communist newspaper, <em>The Daily Worker</em>. It was quite clear that his high position in the Spanish Civil War jump started the rest of his career. That may be why he put his newfound marriage to a woman named Lillian aside to enlist in World War II. After initially being kicked out for being a communist, Gates successfully volunteered as a paratrooper. This was an arduous job for a man in his thirties. Once again he took on a position of authority, this time informal, as a mentor for the much younger paratroopers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite being a veteran, Gates was betrayed by his country. In an incident that gained him infamy, he and ten other comrades were accused of plotting to overthrow the government. Although this claim was denied by all the defendants, it was clear that their Communist ties had made the court view them as enemies of the state during the red scare. Gates was convicted on October 14th, 1949 to a five year jail sentence, characteristic of the McCarthy era.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During this jail time, Gates started questioning much of his philosophies, including Communism. Although posthumously he is known for being one of the most prominent and high ranking members of the Communist Party, Gates actually stopped getting involved in the party in the mid 1900s. Much like POUM, Gates didn&rsquo;t support Stalin, and the Communist Party&rsquo;s increasing alignment with the Soviet Union made him leave. He officially left his communist party position on January 1st, 1958. This was the subject of his book, <em>The Story of an American Communist</em>, a personal memoir published in 1959. Gates&rsquo;s falling out with the American Communist Party had led to the closure of his Communist party controlled newspaper, <em>The Daily Worker</em>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, even after leaving the party Gates still held onto many of his prior beliefs, like the pro-worker stance. This motivated his joining of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union as the senior research assistant, where he helped the workers gain Social Security, unemployment, and compensation. Gates continued his job at the International Ladies Garment Workers Union after serving in World War II, until eventually retiring in 1987. Gates spent his retirement out of the public eye, presumably with his family before dying of heart disease and stroke, in Miami Beach, Florida on May 23rd, 1992 .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At his core, it is evident that John Gates truly cared about social justice. Some of his key values were transitioning to socialism, and loyalty to America. He was survived by his wife, Lillian Gates.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Born in 1904, Alvah Cecil Bessie was the second son of Adeline Schlesinger and Daniel Nathan Cohen Bessie, a successful New York City businessman. He was raised in Harlem and grew up attending public school, ultimately matriculating from DeWitt Clinton High School (then an all- boys school located on Tenth Avenue between 58th Street and 59th Street in Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen) in 1920 to Columbia College, where he earned his degree in English in 1924. After his older brother died and left the Bessie family with significant financial baggage, the younger Bessie was for the first time free of his commanding father&rsquo;s clutches and free to pursue what he wanted. After a four-year stint trying his hand at acting in the New York theater scene and subsequently recognizing his limited capabilities, Bessie decided to pursue writing. In 1928 he took a yearlong trip to France and translated avant-garde French literature while writing, and eventually publishing, his first short story &ldquo;Redbird.&rdquo; He returned to the United States in 1929, and over the following six years was married, moved to Vermont, and had two sons. During this time, as he published numerous stories, essays, and reviews for various magazines and newspapers, Bessie was also writing his first novel Dwell in the Wilderness (1935), which won him a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1935. This was also when he began studying Marxist theory, which, when coupled with his move back to the city in 1935, led to his joining the Communist Party in 1936.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once back in New York (and living at a new residence: 164 Lexington Avenue in Kips Bay, according to his 1937 passport), Bessie was hired by the Brooklyn Daily Eagle as an editor for their drama and book sections. His time there was ripe with disagreement, as his radical stance on several issues (most notably the Spanish Civil War) did not mesh with his superiors&rsquo; conservative views. The final straw, Bessie&rsquo;s support of French novelist, aviator, and activist Andre Malraux&rsquo;s efforts to organize and send a group of French flyers to help the Spanish Republic, led to his resignation from this post in 1937. Shortly thereafter, he found a new position working for the Spanish Information Bureau, a New York propaganda agency of the Spanish Republican government whose purpose was to distribute promotional materials that contained information directly from Spain in order to spread word about what was occurring abroad. During this turbulent period, Bessie&rsquo;s marriage also began to dissipate, and he was shortly thereafter divorced from his wife.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After working for the Spanish Information Bureau all summer and consulting his ex-wife (who told him, &ldquo;If you have to do it, do it&rdquo;), Bessie decided, &ldquo;Hell, I want to go there!&rdquo; and sailed to Spain to join the International Brigade in January of 1938. Much like many of the other Brigade volunteers, Bessie saw the effort not only as a struggle for Spain, but also as a larger fight against fascism and what he deemed the &ldquo;eternal enemy&mdash;oppression.&rdquo; Indeed, years after the war he would say, &ldquo;when I enlisted in the International Brigade of the Spanish Republican Army, I was convinced that I was helping to preserve my country from international fascism.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Bessie had earned his pilot&rsquo;s license before sailing over with the intention to become a flyer, he was put on the front lines with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. He, along with the other new arrivals, quickly discovered that the war effort was not nearly as glamorous as they had envisioned. As he moved with the Brigade towards the Ebro River, Bessie wrote of a lack of adequate supplies (whether it be equipment, medical kits, or food), a near-complete lack of discipline, and seeds of self-doubt, wondering in his diary, &ldquo;Will I be a coward?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bessie soon arrived at his answer when the Lincoln Brigade accidentally stumbled upon a Nationalist camp and had to flee for their lives. For several days, he and three companions straggled towards the Ebro River, whose far bank promised refuge and comrades. However, once there he found similarly destitute conditions amid streets &ldquo;jammed with ragged and demoralized men, wandering idly about.&rdquo; When word came of Nationalist tanks on the way, Bessie and the scraggly band of volunteers made their way to a town further eastward, which they found had at least some semblance of order. Here, they received copies of the International Brigades&rsquo; publication, The Volunteer for Liberty, for which Bessie was a correspondent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Franco&rsquo;s troops advanced towards the Mediterranean Sea, Bessie and the rest of the Brigade knew their cause was becoming more hopeless by the day unless foreign nations provided much- needed aid. Alas, they did not, and by the summer of 1938, Franco&rsquo;s forces controlled most of Spain, with the notable exceptions of Madrid, Barcelona, and Valencia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dire circumstances and dearth of supplies forced the Republic to desperate measures. Commanders began preparing Bessie and the rest of the International Brigade to cross the Ebro River, whose journey promised difficulty enough, but whose destination promised both sure hostility from the Nationalist troops housed there and the foreboding certainty that survival depended solely on capturing enemy supplies (after crossing the Ebro, Bessie wrote in his diary of the lack of food and his and his comrades&rsquo; sleeping &ldquo;in straw, in stone barn[s]; dead tired, hungry, wet with perspiration&rdquo;). This, coupled with the vastly superior arms and numbers of the Nationalist force, made for a grim outlook for Bessie and the rest of the 80,000 troops carrying out the offensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unexpectedly, the slightly inexperienced Nationalist troops on the other side were taken by surprise and shock when the Republic&rsquo;s troops first made their move. But soon after the initial Republican victory, the Nationalists struck back so furiously that Bessie wrote of a full week without taking off his boots, even when resting. The back and forth dragged on and continued through the sweltering summer heat of August, which Bessie described as having drenched the men &ldquo;from head to foot with sweat.&rdquo; The rocky terrain did them no favors either, making digging trenches (and much-needed graves) an impossible endeavor. Food was both scarce and bad (Bessie particularly recalled &ldquo;a petrified sort of blood-sausage that was more gristle than meat&rdquo;), and diarrhea was rampant in the camp. But through it all, Bessie found both time and energy to put into writing his thoughts and experiences, writing one afternoon as he sat awaiting the call to action, &ldquo;At such times the tension is intolerable&hellip; Your stomach clenches and unclenches&hellip; and there is a deep ache in your chest. You look around and you see other men sitting, talking calmly, showing no fear in their faces, acting as though they were on a picnic in the woods&hellip; For men do not like to show fear in the presence of other men, and they put on a good act.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bessie noted that he would act just as coolly as the other men, but knew inside as he watched more and more drafted, spiritless, and unfit Spanish reinforcements arrive that the Republic was becoming increasingly more desperate in its likewise increasingly futile efforts. The Americans remained steadfastly loyal to their cause, but Spanish men began deserting. Even when the Republican side received a rare piece of good news in the form of new anti-aircraft guns, they did almost nothing against the vastly superior Nationalist aircraft, a fact which Bessie described as &ldquo;heart-breaking&rdquo; and only added to his waning confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rare breaks in the constant fighting brought even worse horrors than the chaos it replaced; Bessie recalled trying to &ldquo;[rise] from the narrow niche in which you had been lying in all day[;] it was almost impossible&hellip; you had to look at [your legs] to assure yourself that they were still there, and will them to move.&rdquo; The misfortunes piled on: Bessie&rsquo;s best friend was shot in the eye and shortly thereafter died, a Nationalist shell finding its mark that was a Republican food truck resulted in no food for the night, and, perhaps worst of all, word reached the men of France and Britain&rsquo;s eagerness to placate the increasingly hostile Hitler, which meant that any previous shred of hope for aid from the Western democracies had now all but disappeared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also taking notice of these happenings was Stalin, who was growing continuously convinced that Hitler would be quite a formidable enemy, and one that would need to be faced without the help of France and Britain. Stalin began diverting attention away from Spain, withdrawing Soviet officers and ceasing the shipment of arms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spain&rsquo;s government took note of this and, clinging onto desperate hopes of pressuring Franco into similarly withdrawing his foreign troops, declared in front of the League of Nations that all International Brigaders would be withdrawn from and pushed out of Spain. Bessie knew the Spanish government&rsquo;s gamble was one of low stakes, for of the mere few thousand worn-out Brigaders left, most lay in hospital beds rather than on the frontlines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so, Bessie and the rest of the Americans&rsquo; time in Spain ended in October of 1938, with their efforts culminating in a celebratory march down one of Barcelona&rsquo;s most splendid streets for an official farewell. In their mismatched footwear and run-down attire, the men cried and marched to the tune of raucous cheering from Spanish civilians mingled with the sounds of the Republican planes flying overhead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though his time in Spain had come to an end, Bessie&rsquo;s impact was far from over. Upon his return to the States, his Spanish Civil War journals became the basis of his famous wartime memoir, Men in Battle (1939), which Ernest Hemingway would commend as a &ldquo;true, honest, [and] fine book. Bessie writes truly and finely of all that he could see&hellip; and he saw enough.&rdquo; Bessie would go on to become a celebrated novelist and screenwriter, the latter of which would lead him to a prominent role in the 1940s as one of the blacklisted Hollywood Ten that resisted anti-communist investigations into the film industry by the House of Representatives. Even when not fighting for Spain in uniform, Bessie remained unwaveringly loyal to his Communist and anti-fascist beliefs, continuing the greater fight and purpose of the Spanish Civil War.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Fanny Golub was born on April 18th, 1904 into a Jewish family. Not much is known about her childhood, except that she had a strong passion for helping others. Therefore, it was no surprise when she pursued medicine and graduated in 1926 as &ldquo;Fannie&rdquo; Golub, from the Hunter-Bellevue School of Nursing on East 26th Street in Kips Bay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause she was so dedicated to her work, she went as far as to find a home across the street from Bellevue Hospital. She resided at 142 East 27th Street in Kips Bay throughout the following decade in order to keep her commute short. Whilst she was working at the hospital through the Great Depression, Golub found people who shared her ideology at a local communist organization. Though she was never a certified member of the Communist party, she had strong ties with the Leftist movement and was able to form lifelong connections. Between attending party meetings and working as a nurse, she moved to 142 East 18th Street in Gramercy Park by 1937 which, although further from her workplace, was larger in size. Unfortunately, most records of her affiliation to the communist organization were lost during the McCarthy era.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1936, news was spreading of a Nationalist rebellion led by Spanish Generals. This rebellion rose to overthrow the established Popular Front Republic in Spain. President Roosevelt&rsquo;s administration was critical of any American involvement in this civil war. As the war progressed, Golub grew increasingly concerned that fascism was beginning to take hold as Adolf Hitler offered assistance to the Spanish coup d&rsquo;etat leaders. Golub decided something needed to be done to stop the advance of fascism around the world. On March 24th, 1937 she received passport #378165 and, only a month later, she departed for Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGolub served under Dr. Barksky&rsquo;s team on the battlefront alongside other U.S. nurses, including Salaria Kea, Helen Freeman, Grace Margolis etc. During her time in Spain, it became the norm to work under pressure and with limited resources, including a lack of sterile tools. Many tragedies unfolded around Golub, including bombings, and she grew accustomed to the war-torn environment. On the 15th of April 1938, she was working directly on the Aragon front and witnessed the death of many Abraham Lincoln Brigade volunteers while tending to the wounded. After this unfortunate event, her team retreated to living and working out of a Jesuit college until June of that year. During her stay, she sometimes had to share her clothing and a cot with her fellow volunteers. Despite the many hardships faced during this war, the nurses grew to be very close friends and recalled Golub fondly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGolub left Spain on August 13th, 1938. Unable to travel directly from Spain to the U.S. due to President Roosevelts&rsquo; restrictions, Golub crossed the border to France and spent three to five days in Paris before sailing on the RMS Aquitania to the U.S. Still, Golub&rsquo;s days of fighting fascism were not yet over. In further allegiance against fascism, she served again as a nurse during World War II. Despite many years of service, Golub was discriminated against, possibly due to her gender and religion. She had to file a discrimination complaint, and yet was still determined to continue her service towards helping others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe passed away in Kings County, Brooklyn and was buried by the Jewish Center of Hyde Park. Though she never married or had children in her lifetime, her headstone reads &ldquo;Freedom Fighter&rdquo; and &ldquo;Loving Daughter, Sister, and Aunt&rdquo;.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Born on October 23rd, 1904, Evan Biddle Shipman was the middle child of Ellen McGowan Biddle Shipman, a landscape architect, and Louis Evan Shipman, a successful playwright, editor, and essayist. Shipman grew up in the small, quiet town of Plainfield in Sullivan County, New Hampshire. Growing up in a rural atmosphere, Shipman was surrounded by vast swaths of land, teeming with animals, especially horses. This kindled his interest in horses, which his fans would, later on, consider &ldquo;The greatest writer of thoroughbred racing this continent has ever produced.&rdquo; He was born into a wealthy family as both of his parents were renowned professionals in their careers. This allowed him to pursue his early equestrian interests, which would develop into one of his greatest passions later on, along with writing prose.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter graduating from Oak Park-River Forest High School in June 1917, Shipman became a reporter months later. He also enrolled in Groton School, Massachusetts, and Sailsbury, Connecticut schools, but finished at neither. At Groton, he was noted as an &ldquo;omnivorous reader.&rdquo; However, the New England county fair horse racing scene was too tempting for Shipman and he headed for a new chapter of his life in Europe, where he graduated from the University of Louvain in Belgium and earned his Graduate Degree at The Sorbonne in France.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter university, Shipman went back to America, this time settling in 19 Beckman Place, New York City. However, Shipman headed back to Paris from New York in 1924 to reunite with his father. He had a strong relationship with his father, but a strained one with his mother, so it was important for him to stay connected with his father. His father, Louis, was in Paris with him and they often traveled together between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Shipman had a passion for writing, in part, this can be credited to his father, a renowned playwright.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWriting poems was always a passion for Shipman since it came to him naturally, so he always jumped at the opportunity of getting his work published. In Paris, he was on the hunt for an American named Gotham Munson. Munson was an editor for a small magazine and Shipman hoped he could share his poetry with Munson. However, when he arrived at Munson&rsquo;s address, he was greeted by Ernest Hemingway instead. Munson had moved back to America and Hemingway now lived on the second floor above the sawmill at 113 Rue Notre Dame des Champs (address from a letter to Hemingway from Shipman, 29 October 1949). The two hit off instantaneously and their personalities automatically clicked. They then proceeded to spend hours talking openly. This accidental encounter paved the way for a formative friendship with one of the greatest American novelists of all time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHemingway then introduced Shipman to Gertrude Stein, who introduced him to Andre Masson, a penniless young painter with promise. Hemingway, Shipman, and Masson became close friends and formed a close circle of expatriate Americans in Paris during the 1920s. Stein called them &ldquo;a lost generation.&rdquo; In Paris, Shipman was allowed free thought and liberal actions, where in America he could not. Often, in salons where art and literature were spread, alcohol was on the menu. It stimulated creativity and communication among many artists, similar to the Demimondes in Montmartre, France in the mid-19 century. This led to Shipman&rsquo;s heavy drinking habits, often accompanied by fellow friends, usually Hemingway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring this time, Shipman was also dedicated to his writing, publishing poetry in a variety of magazines, including Transition, Scribner&rsquo;s, The Republic and the Nation, and later in The New Yorker and Esquire. His prose mainly reflected his passion for horse racing and in 1935, Scribner published his novel Free For All, which was about the horse harness sport. His first novel was praised by critics but unfortunately sold poorly. Shipman was an expert on harness breeding and frequently drove horses in workouts. His daily schedule usually included attending a thoroughbred track in the afternoon and a trotting track at night.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen Shipman returned to the states, he married Elizabeth Gerwig of Pittsburgh. However, the marriage did not last long as the couple drank heavily. The final straw was Elizabeth&rsquo;s emotional issues, which led to her confinement in a mental hospital. Shipman wrote a poem &ldquo;Mazeppa,&rdquo; most likely attributed to Gerwig, where he illustrates women as flowers, whose sweet voices turn to the harsh and shrill complaining of strumpets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo escape his marital problems, Shipman returned to Paris in 1937 at Hemingway&rsquo;s request. Shipman volunteered to help Hemingway by delivering three ambulances through France into Spain for the Republican Forces fighting Franco. After successfully delivering the ambulances, Shipman returned to France, where he agreed to lead American volunteers for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade back to Spain. Convinced by Hemingway and in a time of conflict after his failed marriage, Shipman agreed to contribute to something bigger than himself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrough a period of heavy restriction on entry into Spain, Shipman had to lead his men through the precipitous Pyrenees Mountains, where many met their downfall. In an attempt to cross the dangerous, rocky terrain of the mountains at night, the group led by Shipman was discovered and arrested by French border guards. They were immediately jailed for six weeks at Toulouse. However, this didn&rsquo;t stop Shipman and he quickly returned to Spain after his stint in jail.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn May 1937, Shipman arrived in Spain to fight with the Loyalists side in the Spanish Civil War and served in XV Brigade, Washington Battalion, and Lincoln-Washington Battalion until July 18th, 1937. Shipman enlisted as an infantryman and showed immense courage on the battlefield. He still kept in touch with his good friend Hemingway, who described him as &ldquo;pale, ragged, limping and profoundly cheerful,&rdquo; even after several months of battling. Shipman often visited Hemingway during his free time, visiting him at his home in Cuba.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShipman fought courageously during the Battle of Jarama and Battle of Brunete. However, on July 17th, 1937, while fighting at the Brunete, Shipman was hit in both thighs by machine-gun bullets from a strafing plane. Despite the injuries, Shipman claims he never felt a thing during the incident since he was unconscious. However, due to Shipman&rsquo;s injuries from the aerial bombardment, he was sent to recover in Madrid, where he spent 4-5 days convalescing, but then transferred to Murcia in August 1937, where he stayed until January 15th, 1938. The injury would stay with Shipman forever as he carried shrapnel fragments in his leg for the rest of his life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter sustaining this injury, Shipman couldn&rsquo;t return to the battlefield immediately, so he contributed in other ways. He worked as an interpreter for the Quartermasters and as a Hospital Commissar and in mid-January. He was also sent to Madrid, where he wrote video scripts for the Voice of Spain. In Spring 1938, he was sent to Barcelona as editor of the Volunteer of Liberty, and later in May, Shipman was discharged and repatriated back to America. The journey back was difficult as Shipman was arrested once again by the French Guarde Mobile for an illegal border crossing into France. Due to Shipman&rsquo;s likable nature, the French officers bought Shipman cognac and tobacco out of their own money and didn&rsquo;t handcuff him as usual. Eventually, Shipman avoided the charges by leaving France for America.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter participating in the Spanish Civil War and contributing greatly to the Republican side, Shipman returned to America on June 21st, 1938, where he immediately hustled his way back to writing. He became a columnist for New York&rsquo;s Morning Telegraph, a renowned newspaper covering professional sports. However, Shipman&rsquo;s calling sent him on a different path, when he then enlisted in World War II, where he was a correspondent. He was also sergeant major of the Sixteenth Armored Division&rsquo;s Sixteenth Regiment and was with the 787th Tank Battalion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter World War II, Shipman became more invested in his writing and was highly regarded as a horse-racing columnist and writer. Due to his keen observation and technical knowledge of horseracing, he was extremely important in the horseracing industry. He was later made a featured columnist of the Morning Telegraph, free to write whatever he wanted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy the time Shipman was 50, he was considered &ldquo;a fine ruin of a man,&rdquo; but this didn&rsquo;t prevent him from continuing his passion in the horse racing tracks. To this day, there is a horse race named after Shipman called the Evan Shipman Handicap (NYB).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShipman&rsquo;s health eventually deteriorated and he died of cancer in 1957 in New York Hospital. He was then buried in his family cemetery in Plainfield, New Hampshire. Though Shipman died at 53, the impact the Spanish Civil War had on him was life-changing and one that he never forgot. Writing to his friend Hemingway, who he managed to stay tight with even through a long-distance relationship, he described himself as &ldquo;in a bad state in many ways, both discouraged and confounded,&rdquo; before the war but by the time he journeyed home, though, he was a different man. &ldquo;After such a long time, I feel a real eagerness for work. Again I have confidence in myself.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Aaron Lopoff was born on January 25th, 1914 in NYC. He attended Texas A&amp;M University for one year and NYU for an unspecified amount of time. In Lopoff&rsquo;s early teens, he &ldquo;hoboed&rdquo; all around the States, worked his way part way through college and &ldquo;Then I sort of got bored&rdquo; as he would say in which he then made a living by writing fiction stories for magazines. On August 11, 1937 when Lopoff was a young man 23 years of age, he sailed on Queen Mary to Spain for the Spanish Civil war. At this time, according to Lopoff&rsquo;s passport that he received on August 3rd, 1937 his address was listed as 219 East 12th Street, NYC (Spring Valley, New York). He ultimately arrived in Spain on August 22, 1937.Aaron Lopoff served with the XV BDE, Lincoln-Washington BN, Co.2 as Lieutenant, company commander and adjutant. Lopoff was a respected man, his anti-fascist understanding along with his desire to lead his company better made the Command of the Lincoln to consider Aaron Lopoff as one of its most experienced and responsible leaders. As Lopoff used to say: &ldquo;When you have a lot of other guys to worry about, you can&rsquo;t be afraid for yourself&rdquo; Lopoff was the type of leader that wanted to spare as much of his comrades as he possibly can. These characteristics made the people around Lopoff respect him as they can feel the sense of responsibility that this man has. On the night of August 17th, 1938 during the Ebro Offensive on Hill 666, Lopoff was wounded in action- receiving 3 m.g bullets to the head, and destroyed one eye which may have resulted in the loss of the other. Aaron Lopoff later died in the hospital due to his wounds. Lopoff was single prior to his death, there were no records of him being married and he does not have any known offspring. Aaron Lopoff was a brother figure to Alvah Bessie, another famous veteran that served in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Lopoff served as Bessie&rsquo;s company commander and most of what we&rsquo;ve learned of Lopoff comes from Bessie&#39;s notebook that later on was published.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Michael &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; Patrick McLaughlin was an Irish-Canadian-American who fought alongside the Republic against Franco&rsquo;s fascist forces during the Spanish Civil War in the Abraham Lincoln Battalion and Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, which were in the Fifteenth (XV) International Brigade. McLaughlin was born to a devout Catholic Irish family on September 24, 1890, in Ballyhaunis, County Mayo, Ireland. The repercussions of the Irish Famine were still drastic, and Ballyhaunis was still held back in an agrarian, rural society, which resulted in McLaughlin&rsquo;s life in poverty. He was the son of James McLaughlin and Mary Nolan. He had a large family, with four other siblings (Delia McDonough, Bernhard McLaughlin, James McLaughlin, and Jack McLaughlin), which was common in rural societies. The socioeconomic disparities in Great Britain, especially between the British and the Irish, would eventually spur him to be a passionate Marxist communist, thereby motivating him to fight for the Communist Republican forces on behalf of Canada and America in the Spanish Civil War a few decades later. Not much is recorded about his adolescence or time before his residency in Canada, but it is assumed that he helped his family through agriculture, which was very common in late 19th, early 20th century Ireland. Due to the bucolic nature of Northern Ireland at that time, it is likely he did not get an education. The known schools in Ballyhaunis would be founded in the late 20th century.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As was common with many Irish people, he emigrated elsewhere in hopes of finding employment opportunities and a better standard of living. He moved to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and married Ellen Costello (1894-1974) in 1915. They had four children together: Margaret Stevens (1916-?), John Thomas McLaughlin (1917-2006), Eileen Jordon (1925-?), and John James McLaughlin (1927-?). He was a humble man, working as a coal miner in Canada, seeking political and social clubs to support his large family. Throughout his time in the Western Hemisphere leading up to his involvement in the Spanish Civil War, he would travel to and from Canada and the USA, developing his passion for communism and anti-fascism. Accordingly, he resided in New York City, New York, USA on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He would join the American Federation of Labor in 1918 and become the New York Secretary of the Communist Party of the USA in 1935. Conversely, he was a member of the Communist Party of Canada in 1935.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being spurred by his comrades in the Communist Parties, he became dedicated to the interests of the Popular Front-led Republic in Spain. Still living in poverty, he decided that his calling would be in Spain to resist the evils of fascism and potentially implement communist ideals in the shattered Republic. Along with many other volunteers in the XV International Brigade from NYC, he boarded the <em>Washington</em> on March 10, 1937. It is recorded that he arrived in Spain on April 8, 1937, likely at Albacete, due to the time of his journey and the fact that Albacete was the center for the International Brigades. He was assigned to the Abraham Lincoln Battalion on June 5, 1937, which was predominantly American-composed and named after famous American President Abraham Lincoln. McLaughlin, along with other Canadian immigrants and Canadian natives, named themselves the Mackenzie-Papineau Section, after the famed William Lyon Mackenzie and Louis-Joseph Papineau of Canada, who led the Rebellion of 1837-1838 in Canada.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He first saw action with his comrades during the Brunete Campaign in July 1937, which was a devastating failure for the International Brigades. He witnessed the deaths of many of his peers during that time, and he was badly wounded in his head and hip. After the unfortunate results of the Brunete Campaign, he pushed for the formation of a Canadian Battalion with some of his Canadian comrades, which led to the formal establishment of the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion in July 1937. After being transported to northern Spain, he witnessed his second major battle, the Aragon Offensive in March 1938. He was often characterized as being lighthearted, carefree, drunk, and physically weak by his colleagues, which contributed to his dwindling war performance. This became such an issue that during the Aragon offensive, he was arrested by Republican officials in April 1938 at Las Presas for drunkenness and jailed for 15 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Nationalist forces continuously pressed on the International Brigades, McLaughlin sought to exit the war out of exhaustion and misconduct. He traveled to the Pyrenees mountains and snuck through them to get into France to ultimately return to America. He rode by train all the way up to Le Havre, France, where he would return to New York City clandestinely aboard the <em>Britannic </em>by October 13, 1938.&nbsp;He would become officially naturalized as an American citizen on December 15, 1938. He would stay in the USA for the rest of his life, living a hidden and peaceful life in his humble apartment on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. He died on February 26th, 1974, and he was buried in the Calvary Cemetery of Queens, New York City.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>P.S</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with many volunteers in the Spanish Civil War, there was a lack of photographic records of them; the most that has been discovered at this time for the common soldier would be a group picture, like the one with the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion provided by ALBA&#39;s <em>The Volunteer</em>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://albavolunteer.org/2016/06/jarama-series-canadians-in-the-lincoln-battalion/\" target=\"_blank\">https://albavolunteer.org/2016/06/jarama-series-canadians-in-the-lincoln-battalion/</a>). Unfortunately, this truth holds evident with McLaughlin, whose precise identity has still not been found. From some of the provided portraits in the archives, a considerable amount of volunteers in the group photo could be eliminated as being McLaughlin. Additionally, from contemporaneous, written archives, one could deduce McLaughlin to be the man in the third row because of his short stature and considerably weak physique, as noted by his peers. As the world continues to draw note of the implications of the Spanish Civil War and give a deeper dive into its history and the valiant men and women who fought within it, hopefully, McLaughlin&#39;s identity could be definitively pinpointed. At this moment, though, this unknown person appears to be a plausible&nbsp;candidate for McLaughlin.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Jacob (Jack) Shulman was born on July 29, 1914, as the fifth of seven children of Jewish refugees who fled Czarist Russia. Both of his parents arrived in Canada en route to the United States in 1902, where they met each other and eventually moved to Rochester, New York. His father worked as a house painter, and his mother as a washerwoman. From these humble beginnings, Shulman managed to win a scholarship to Cornell University, where he took part in the Reserve Officers&rsquo; Training Corps. However, he was forced to drop out as a result of the economic ramifications of the Great Depression. Despite having come from a rather conservative family, the three years he spent at Cornell exposed him to leftist thinking, and Shulman then became engaged in politics, joining the Young Communist League in 1930.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In February of 1937, at the tender age of 23, he organized a group of 18 fellow communists and took a ship to France, intending to cross into Spain and join the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. He chose to fight because he was unemployed at the time, and held the strong conviction that the emergence of fascism would spark another world war. Organized in groups of 6 or 7 people, they posed as students and tourists and reached France by March. However, due to a breakdown in the Spanish railroad system, he spent about 2 weeks sheltered in the attic of a school building in the town of Sete in southern France. Eventually, several taxi cabs arrived, which Shulman and his comrades were marshaled into and hurriedly driven to the Pyrenees overnight by a group of professional Andorran smugglers. He crossed over in Catalonia, and was picked up by trucks from the small nearby town of Figueras.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once in Spain, he held an edge over his peers in regards to experience, as he had been previously familiar with military chains of command, points of discipline, instruction, and organization, whereas the others had no military training whatsoever. Shulman was assigned to the artillery corps of the George Washington Battalion, stationed just outside of Madrid, and due to his ROTC experience and basic knowledge of artillery, he was considered a seasoned miltiaryman and immediately promoted to sergeant. Ironically enough, his artillery unit of 15-20 people was not in possession of any artillery, and was not even big enough to be considered a unit. Because Italian fascists had torpedoed Russian ships smuggling 76 millimeter artillery guns via the Black Sea, the Republicans were forced to resort to using &ldquo;very old, obsolete, ancient&rdquo; cannons left over from the 1890s, although Shulman remarks that they appeared almost as if they were holdovers from the Napoleonic Wars. The guns had large wooden wheels that were about six feet high, and shot seven to eight inch shells. With no horses or pack animals, the ammunition and weapons had to be transported and handled using sheer manpower. The operation of these weapons was also quite dangerous: the Republicans were often less concerned with the fascists than they were with the artillery backfiring or exploding in their faces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, Shulman was in Spain for about 2 years and 2 months, during which he battled both malaria and the elements. By fall of 1938, he was officially withdrawn from his position, retreating to Albacete. He was meant to be evacuated through Valencia, but the boats never arrived, and the city was soon cut off by the fascists. Eventually, he managed to make his way out to Barcelona with his unit via an old coal freighter, in suffocatingly dusty conditions. During the siege of Barcelona, Shulman bravely volunteered to go out to try to defend the city, despite hardly anyone previously making it out alive. As the volunteer group was only 7 men strong, they were refused by the military leaders. One of these seven was in fact a man named Vincent Lossowski, the son of working-class Polish immigrants who had previously known Shulman in Rochester, and had only reunited with him as they were leaving Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By January 25, 1939, seeing as the situation was hopeless, the surviving volunteers were sent on a rickety train back to the French border, and just in time, as Barcelona soon fell. Both individuals distinctly recall a ragged old woman begging for food by the side of the train tracks, who they felt perfectly represented the situation that they had left behind. Shulman recalls the bitterness and utter helplessness he experienced at the time: &ldquo;We were very much disappointed in the democratic countries for not helping the Spanish Republic,&rdquo; he reflects, &ldquo;We were fighting to prevent World War II. What we did there was a failed effort, but it was an effort that had to be made. By fighting fascism in Spain, we delayed the start of World War II by three years.&rdquo; However, he also acknowledges that the volunteers knew very well that it wasn&rsquo;t the end of the matter - rather, they &ldquo;knew it was just the beginning.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shulman and the remaining volunteers were escorted onto a large ocean liner under a military escort in the port town of Le Havre. Unfortunately, many Spanish Republicans, civilians, and refugees who also crossed over from the Pyrenees were placed into internment camps by the French, where they were kept for 3 to 5 years, but the Americans avoided this fate, as they were foreigners. The volunteers eventually arrived in New York City, met by a celebratory, excited crowd. However, the US government was not as thrilled in regards to the matter. &ldquo;Guys from the FBI kept coming around,&rdquo; he revealed in an interview, &ldquo;They terrified my mother and father, asking about me and Spain.&rdquo; They had confiscated and burned a suitcase full of letters, souvenirs, and memorabilia from Spain that he kept at his parents&rsquo; Rochester home, and continued to harass him up to his enlistment in the Second World War.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shulman made it back to Rochester with Lossowski by February 7, 1939, and was shocked to be greeted by about 400 people at the city&rsquo;s New York Central train station. Despite having left Rochester covertly, when he came back, &ldquo;it seemed like everyone knew it.&rdquo; Once he got back home, he was greeted by his worrysick mother, who remarked &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your arms, you&rsquo;ve got your legs - what more could I ask?&rdquo; as she embraced him.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon settling back down, he became a full-time member of the CPUSA. He worked closely with prominent communist leader William Z. Foster as his secretary, and was sent on numerous outreach missions to survey the extent of the spread of &lsquo;Browderism,&rsquo; the following of Earl Browder, a former leader of the CPUSA who was widely considered to be a &lsquo;revisionist,&rsquo; and unfaithful to Marxist-Leninist ideals. Shulman also volunteered for the U.S. Army in 1944. Although he was considered old, his prior military experience made him a prime candidate for officerial training, and upon informing army officials that he had been in an artillery corps in Spain, they were also &ldquo;awfully eager&rdquo; to send him to field artillery schools in order to teach newcomers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later on in life in 1959 and 1960, he also travelled to Cuba, serving as Foster&rsquo;s eyes and ears, and then went to Albania after Foster died on September 1, 1961, while in the Soviet Union. At this point, Shulman was heavily criticized and ostracized by other members of the party, and gradually distanced himself from its leaders. In 1968, he went on to visit China during the &ldquo;Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution&rdquo; &mdash; Mao Zedong&rsquo;s purge that lasted from 1966 to 1976. There, he served as an English editor for the Peking Press, but, eventually coming to believe that China was turning revisionist, he returned to Albania, where he started the USA-Albania Friendship Association and published the Albania Report, as well as publicizing and distributing Albanian literature in America and other nations. After the fall of communism in 1989, he supported the International Struggle Marxist-Leninist (ISML), and was also a source of great assistance and encouragement to Indian Marxist-Leninists. Shulman passed away on October 19, 1999, in Brooklyn, although by 2008, his American associates had formed the anti-revisionist, Hoxhaist party, the American Party of Labor. One such associate, a writer for the Red Phoenix, Alfonso Casal, aptly remarks: &ldquo;Jack was an amazing man, a true comrade, and a dear friend.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Jacob Louis Teiger, who also went by Jack, Jake, Jakob, etc., was born on February 6. 1914 in Brooklyn, New York to Samuel Teiger and Sylvia Teiger. Teiger, who was of Jewish descent, only received a year of a high school education, becoming a dental technician and a hatter afterward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On April 23, 1937, he received his passport, and on May 8th of that year, Jacob Teiger was onboard the American Importer as a volunteer in the Spanish Civil War. He arrived in Spain after crossing the Pyrenes Mountains through what is called the Massanet route. He served as a part of the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, the XV International Brigade (in which the Lincoln Battalion was a part of), the Lincoln-Washington Battalion, and the Lincoln Battalion Co.2, serving in the Lincoln Battalion and the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion from August 1937 to December 1938.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his time as a volunteer, he was shot in the left leg and received shrapnel in his right. Although he recovered, the damp weather did not favor him, frequently bothering him and eventually permanently disqualified him from service when he served in World War II. He was also admitted into the Farners de la Selva Hospital on September 14. 1938 for a wounded hand, which caused him to miss the parade in Barcelona.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teiger was involved in the Battle of Ebro, where he was dive-bombed and was torpedoed. Teiger remembers being with a Lopez from San Francisco at the time and credits them both in straightening the rest of the group out after the torpedo had killed eight and injured 10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teiger&rsquo;s comrades seemed to have varying opinions of Teiger. Some claimed that he got along well with his fellow volunteers. Others said that he was vicious and slanderous towards his uppers. The latter at the least seems likely as Teiger, who was adamant in his political beliefs and was willing to get into arguments about his beliefs. Teiger was a Communist, a member of the Communist Party and the Young Communist League, and heavily disliked liberals and Trotskyites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He returned back to the United States on September 24, 1942 onboard the Ausonia, after which he enlisted in World War II and worked as a guard and, much to his chagrin, a truck driver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps due to communist affiliations, Teiger was put on the list of hearings by the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws on the Judiciary United States Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He married &ldquo;Sara&rdquo; Savilla Cogswell in 1945 and died on August 23, 1976, in Baltimore. Cogswell, however, attended Abraham Lincoln Brigade reunions after Teiger&#39;s death with her husband and stepson.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>George Sidney Hendrickson was born on December 21st, 1906. He was born to father George Hendrickson and mother Mary Carberry. His father worked many trades, from carpenter, to motorman, to hospital attendant. His mother was initially a saleswoman, but later became a public school teacher. Just as both of his parents had, Hendrickson grew up in Brooklyn, alongside siblings Elizabeth, Albert, Marietta, Margaret, and Monetta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHendrickson never graduated from high school, completing only his first year. After high school he served in the US Army. He also held various other jobs, such as manning train signals, and working as a radio operator. At the time of his volunteering for the war effort, he was single and living in the Bronx, working as a mechanic. Hendrickson became a member of the Communist Party, and the International Workers Order, in 1936. He went over to Spain with the first 96 volunteers aboard the Normandie on December 26, 1936, and arrived in Spain on January 11th, 1937.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn Spain, Hendrickson worked with transmissions, because he had been trained as a radio operator during his time in the Merchant Marines. He then went on to work as a wireless radio operator due to his particular skill. He served in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade until May 1937, &nbsp;but spent the greater part of the war as a radio operator out of Valencia. He&rsquo;s recorded as having worked under volunteer &Oacute;scar Hern&aacute;ndez Rodr&iacute;guez in Valencia. It&rsquo;s also described, in Sidney Kaufman&rsquo;s telling of the war, that he and Kaufman set up a radio while staying at a woman named Maria&rsquo;s house, and listened to broadcasts announcing the arrival of the British consul in Cerbere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn late 1937, the Lincoln Brigade was &nbsp;deployed to defend the walled mountain town of Teruel against the anticipated Nationalist counterattack. That winter, from 1937 to 1938, is noted as having been one of the coldest on record. Many soldiers suffered frostbite. It was in these conditions that Hendrickson found himself working alone, on Christmas, out of an outpost in La Muela, Teruel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nLike many others, Hendrickson lost friends and peers in the war effort. Communication regarding these losses was limited on the warfront. Hendrickson wrote a letter to a fellow &ldquo;comrade,&rdquo; asking them to verify the reported death of Jim Ambers, an American who to his knowledge had never joined the battalion, at his current address in Spain. According to the letter, Hendrickson &ldquo;knew [Ambers] well.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHendrickson returned to the United States on February 9th, 1939, with one of the final groups to leave Spain. He went on to serve during World War II, continuing his work as a radio operator for the Merchant Marines, and joined the Seven Seas Club in 1943, made primarily up of seamen who were also card-carrying Communists. On April 2nd, 1949, Hendrickson married Rosalind (Beatrice) Tvenstup. Rosalind herself had never completed her high school education, due to her family&rsquo;s poverty and her mother&rsquo;s illness, but instead worked many jobs. The Great Depression and Spanish Civil War were also formative for her, and she was a political activist and Communist like her husband.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn 1957, the Department of Defense notified George Hendrickson that his previous military clearance, from his many years of service, had been suspended. The notice listed the various reasons for this suspension, the primary ones being that Hendrickson was or had been a member of the Communist Party, International Workers Order, and served in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil War. The letter explained that all three organizations had been &ldquo;designated by the Attorney General&hellip; as organizations whose interests are in conflict with those of the United States.&rdquo;<br />\r\nGeorge Hendrickson died in Ossipee, New Hampshire, on October 30th, 1976, and was buried in Tewksbury, Massachusetts.</p>\r\n",

He went to Technical/Trade School for six years, and, at the age of 16, Stephen joined the Young Communist League in 1932.&nbsp; The Communist League, which was initially founded in 1920, was said to develop its members into Communists, through studying Marxism&ndash;Leninism and through active participation in the struggles of the American working class.&nbsp; Only 5 years later, Stephen joined the Communist Party, in January 1937.&nbsp; The Communist Party, was a political party organized to <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/facilitate\" target=\"_blank\">facilitate</a> the transition of society from <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/capitalism\" target=\"_blank\">capitalism</a> through <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/socialism\" target=\"_blank\">socialism</a> to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/communism\" target=\"_blank\">communism</a>. During this time in the Communist Party, he was a member of the syndicats, but was mostly a part of the militia wing of the organization. He took part in several demonstrations for work and social aid, and strikes for better factory conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He briefly worked in a sugar factory that employed eight hundred people. New York City was once the sugar capital of the world. The ports and piers of New York, specifically those in Brooklyn, made this kingdom of sugar possible. Sugar was big business, and Brooklyn&rsquo;s sugar barons were some of the city&rsquo;s wealthiest men. Raw cane was shipped from tropical countries around the world, offloaded into warehouses and processed here. The refineries extracted the sugar in various forms, and the goods were further packaged and distributed across the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to going to Spain to fight in the Civil War, Stephen had completed three years of service in the US Army, in the New York National Guard. He was part of the 71st Infantry, where he worked in the engineering office with two hundred people, making twenty-four dollars a week, which is the equivalent of $363.45 today. He joined the Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists and Technicians, which was a part of the CIO, the Congress of Industrial Organizations. During the 1930s, as unemployment among architects and draftsmen in the United States reached 90 percent or more, practitioners joined with other technical workers to form the Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists and Technicians (FAECT).&nbsp; From 1933 until after World War II, the FAECT served as a trade union and activist organization for the purpose of securing higher wages, employment benefits, and labor rights.&nbsp; During this time he lived at 113 East 3rd Street and 1st Avenue, NYC.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As he prepared to go to Spain, he received his passport, # 466079, on July 30, 1937.&nbsp; Stephen left for Spain, shortly afterwards, in August, 1937. He set sail aboard the <em>Queen Mary</em> on the 11th of the month. The construction of the Queen Mary ship began with a design completed in 1928, and while the actual building started in 1930, work was suspended several times and was finally completed in March of 1936.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On August 21, Zak arrived in Espolla, which is in Catalonia, Spain. After about five weeks, he joined the 15th Brigade of the Lincoln-Washington Battalion, and he was a member of Company 3. This lasted from October to December 7th, 1937, at which point, he changed companies. He moved from Company 3 to the Brigade MG Company, where he remained until March 12, 1938. After only a week with his new company, he took part in the Battle of Teruel which was a grueling struggle in which the Republican Army was able to kill around 57,000 Nationalist Rebels, but as many as 85,000 Republicans died, and to make matters worse, the battle ended with the Nationalists in control of the battlefield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On March 12, he moved to the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, until July 6, 1938. From July 6, to when he left Spain on December 20, 1938, he was a member of the 35th Division, Special MG Battalion, with whom he fought at the Battle of Fuentes de Ebro, which included the retreats and the Ebro Offensive, where, even though many of his friends within the battalion died in the attempt to claim victory, the Republican Army was decisively defeated and the territory loyal to the Spanish Republic was split in two. He returned to the US aboard the <em>Ausonia</em>. In 1939 RMS Ausonia was requisitioned by the Admiralty at the outbreak of World War II to serve as an armed merchant cruiser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the war, Stephen Zak had a fairly quiet life, he married Rhoda Loesberg, who was born on 13 July 1911. Her father, Abraham Paul Loesberg, was 27 and her mother, Esther Loesberg, was 25 at the time she was born.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stephen and Rhoda had a daughter, Linda Jane Zak Weintraub, born in 1942 in New York. Linda married Jerome M Weinraub, who was a Physician, Licence # 118903. They married in 1968, when Linda was 25 years old.&nbsp; She died at the young age of 43, in 1986.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stephen Zak died 5 years after his daughter, in July 1991.</p>\r\n",

On July 23, 1937, he was wounded in the face and arms by shrapnel while loading patients into his ambulance, and stayed at the hospital at Hoyo de Manzanares for 7 to 8 days.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe worked as a mechanic and an ambulance driver at an Auto Park in Albacete from August 15, 1937 to April 15, 1938, where he became responsible for the American group. He was sentenced to 10 days of confinement in December 1937 due to a fight, which he thought was done &ldquo;merely to discredit [him].&rdquo; He went to guerilla school in Barcelona from April 15, 1938 to July 38, 1938. He became the administrator and political commissar of the International Brigade in Horta from July 1938 to October 1938. In all, he held the roles of Sergeant, Chief of Transport Section, Chief of Material of Transport Battalion, and Political Commissar.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYellin requested repatriation in September 1937, and returned to the U.S. on December 20, 1938 aboard the Ausonia. He later participated in World War Two in the U.S. Navy as a radar mechanic from April 1944 to December 1945.<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\nYellin spoke English, Spanish, and a bit of French and German. He was described as a &ldquo;good anti-fascist&rdquo; and &ldquo;politically reliable.&rdquo; He became a member of the Communist Party of Spain in late 1937, and joined the Young Communist League. He married Anne Yellin, and died on April 27, 1972.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>William James &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; Bailey, most notably as, Bill Bailey, was born on January 23, 1910. He grew up in Hoboken, New Jersey and in Jersey City, in a family of 13 children. Unfortunately, seven children died before the age of one, with just six children, including him, to remain. They lived in poverty due to their Irish identity which made it really hard to be employed during the early 1900&rsquo;s America. His parents eventually split due to his father&rsquo;s alcohol addiction and inability to earn enough money to support the family. As Bailey recalled, his father never had a paternal love for his family. He was arrested for constantly picking fights drunk and physically abusing his mother. When they finally split, Bailey noted his father&rsquo;s sense of liberation from the burden of being a father, which was heartbreaking for Bailey to see that his father resented them so much. They never met again until many years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nTo make sure that the family had enough to live by, Bailey&rsquo;s mother would go out to New York City Wall Street every day in search of a job. She would usually work as a maid and scrubbed floors. His sister, Kate would work at a church for 15 cents an hour, and his brother, John would work at a bakery. They were both eventually fired from their jobs when Kate ran away stealing a ham and when John stole doughnuts from the bakery shop. Because his family lived in such poverty, his brother would steal bottles of milk from other people, leading to his arrest to jail and reform school. Bailey went to Catholic school in St. Peters Church and had an education until he was in the fifth grade when his mother pulled him out of school in order to get a job and to start working. He later started to work for an Irishman that was living upstairs from him at the waterfront. He would work for six days a week for $21.52. After that, his family decided to move to New York near Hell&#39;s Kitchen, on West 38th Street between 9th and 10th Avenues for work. He eventually started sailing in 1929-1930 on a ferry boat at Pier 1 and earned $47 a month, which was considered a fortune at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHowever, he suffered from miserable working conditions, prompting him to join the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1929 and later, Marine Workers&rsquo; Industrial Union (MWIU) in 1930 to help fight for the rights and welfare of seamen. At first, he was hesitant about joining the Union, mainly because there was a fee that he had to pay every month for membership and he was at the time not able to afford it. However, once he joined, he was very invested and passionate about the causes they were fighting for. He became the union organizer. He eventually developed an interest in reading about the Soviet Union as he worked with members of a group of communists called the POC and later decided to become a member of the Communist Party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHis loyalty and enthusiasm as a communist member naturally caused him to be an anti-fascist along with the other members of his party. When word came out that an American seaman, Lawrence Simpson was arrested in Germany for bringing in anti-fascist literature, Bailey along with the other communist seamen decided to gather at the dock of a German ship, S.S. Bremen in New York, which was ready to sail from Pier 46 on 46th Street on July 26th, 1935. This act against fascism attracted the attention of thousands of people as they watched Bailey and a few other men cut the Bremen&rsquo;s swastika down and into the Hudson River. They were arrested but released and dismissed of any charges due to their courageous act against Nazism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNews about the war in Spain was spreading like wild-fire in New York where Bailey resided. He was very invested in the idea that action was finally being taken against fascism and sprang for the opportunity to volunteer in the war because he believed that if fascism can be defeated in the Spanish Civil War, then it can be defeated anywhere. He joined the Abraham Lincoln Battalion seamen&rsquo;s machine gun company sailing from his home address 191 (198) 11th Avenue, NYC (as stated in his passport) on June 16th, 1937 on the ship Aquitania, and arrived in Spain on June 31st, 1937. He rose to rank as the Company Commissar and was recognized for his bravery and strong will when fighting at Belchite and even managing to obtain a fascist banner which he sent back to the United States. On July 14th, 1937, the Lincoln Battalion merged with the George Washington Battalion after heavy losses from both sides. At the end of the Spanish Civil War, he returned on to the US on December 20, 1938, aboard the Ausonia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBailey&rsquo;s contributions to the fight against fascism do not end after the Spanish Civil War. He later served as a business agent for the Marine Firemen, Oilers, and Watertenders Union (MFOW), before joining and shipping himself out to the invasion of the Philippines as a mariner under MFOW working aboard the U.S flag vessels to prevent the risk of sending more and more men out to their deaths. Later in the Korean War (1950-1953), he was blacklisted from working in the Merchant Marine due to his membership in the Communist Party. In 1953 he began to work as a longshoreman and continued to do so until he retired in 1975.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBailey, recognized by his many contributions to the war effort continued to have a lasting impact to this day. He was in numerous documentaries including, Seeing Red (1983) and The Good Fight (1984). He also has his own autobiography dedicated to his son called, The Kid from Hoboken. Bill Bailey died on February 27, 1995, with his ashes spread across the sea. From working hard at the sea ever since he was little, joining unions and the Communist Party to help fight for his rights, to joining the Abraham Lincoln Brigades to help fight against fascism, Bill Bailey was definitely an honorable and strong fighter in support of his beliefs and passions until the very end.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>At the turn of the 20th century, New York City&rsquo;s garment industry experienced a rapid expansion, and with it came an influx of Eastern European Jewish immigrants seeking employment in the United States. Approximately 75% of the workers employed in this industry were Jewish, many of whom were attracted by the prospect of working for Jewish employers who could provide a familiar social environment as well as the opportunity to observe the Sabbath. Although, the rise in employment opportunities also meant that these workers were exposed to widespread exploitative conditions which subjected these individuals to hazardous working conditions for a relatively low pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAbraham &ldquo;Abe&rdquo; Schwartz was one of the many Jewish textile workers who witnessed the numerous investigations, labor strikes, and public demonstrations that occurred in response to the unsafe conditions many in the Jewish community had worked in. Which in turn, motivated his decision to not only embrace Leftist political ideology, but participate in the fight for democracy in the Spanish Civil War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOn February 28th, 1934, Schwartz received his passport (#80010), and listed his place of residence as 2187 Douglass street, Brooklyn, New York. He set sail on February 20th, 1937, lle de France, and arrived in Spain on March 14th, 1937.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nDuring his time in Spain, Schwartz served with the XV BDE, Washington Brigade, and died the night of Yom Kippur in the Villa Paz Hospital in May 1937 of Typhoid malignant malaria, military tuberculosis, and Lobar pneumonia. The following day, he was buried in the village cemetery of Saelices. During which, the Political Commissar spoke about Schwartz&rsquo;s achievements and his Antifascist work. As his coffin was lowered, the Spaniards attending the burial sang &ldquo;Internationale&rdquo;, in honor of his bravery during the war effort, and as a soldier who left his family and future behind to fight for democracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn a letter addressed to her brother, Rose Freed, Schwartz&rsquo;s bedside nurse, described the veteran as an amicable man. Schwartz had endeared all who met him, and became fast friends with many of the Spanish villagers living in Saelices. Freed was especially close to Schwartz, citing his death as the saddest experience she endured during her year-long stay in Spain. She explained that she was at his bedside when he died. His mind was still clear enough for him to speak about not only his own family, but also the issues he faced as a member of the working class.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Leslie Kish (originally L&aacute;szl&oacute; Kiss) was born on July 27, 1910, in Popra-Felka, Slovakia which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He is of Hungarian descent. In 1925, his family chose to immigrate to the US in a wave of Hungarian immigration. As the great Hungarian poet Attila Jozsef put it: &ldquo;one and a half million of our people staggered out to America.&rdquo; His father died soon after their arrival forcing Leslie, then 16, to work during the day and attend Bay Ridge Evening School at night to support his mother and 3 siblings. They settled at 335 East 79th Street, NY and his mother opened up a pastry shop in Manhattan. Kish went on to study at the City College of New York Evening School while working as a lab assistant at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. In 1937, he became a US citizen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy 1937, he only had a year left to complete his degree but instead chose to suspend his education and fight fascism in Spain. On March 14, he arrived in Spain as a volunteer for the Loyalists. There, he was initially assigned to a medical unit. Eventually, however, he met a Hungarian man at a bar who told him, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to go through basic training,&#39;&rdquo; he recalled. &ldquo;&lsquo;You go right to the front, we train you with the rifles, and you start shooting. And also, we have the best cooks.&#39;&rdquo; And so, Kish made his way to the front of the Hungarian Battalion and was injured in the Battle of Huesca in June of 1937. Afterward, he spent three weeks at the Benicasim Hospital and eventually joined the John Brown Battery which was positioned on the Estremadura Front from October through December 1937. They eventually relocated to the Toledo Front, where they remained until the Internationals were repatriated. By the end of the war, he was ranked Teniente (Lieutenant). He returned to NYC on February 4, 1939, aboard the SS President Harding. Kish resumed going to night school at City College and completed his BS in Mathematics cum laude.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1940, he moved to Washington DC and was hired by the US Census Bureau. A year later, he moved to the Division of Program Surveys of the Department of Agriculture and joined a group of social scientists that created a survey research unit. During World War II, he once again chose service to justice over his career, working as a meteorologist of the US Air Army Corps. In 1947, his research group went on to work at the University of Michigan and founded the Institute for Social Research, the world&rsquo;s largest academic survey and research organization. There he developed the Kish grid, a statistical randomized surveying method as well as sampling techniques that were used in the 1948 election to predict the victory of Harry Truman. There, he received his MA in mathematics and Ph.D. sociology, while also working full-time as a lecturer and researcher. Kish became Professor Emeritus of Sociology in 1981 and founded the Sampling Program for Foreign Statisticians which trains statisticians from developing countries. He passed away on October 7, 2000 at the age of 90. Since his death, the Institute of Social Research established the Leslie Kish International Fellowship which funds foreign students studying survey sampling.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Jack Waters, better known as Samuel Wiederhorn, was a Jewish New Yorker, born on August 11, 1911, in eastern Bronx. He spent 4 years in the military as a mechanic for the 104th Artillery regiment from 1928 to 1931, enlisting after having received a high school diploma (no info found on attended schools). He became a member of the Young Communists&#39; league during this time, as a unit organizer and later mechanic in 1933. Due to this, he had a military background previously to joining the fight in the Spanish Civil War. In 1935, he received a Spanish passport from the Soviet Union, and in 1937 flew from Moscow to Spain along with other members of the Lincoln Battalion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Initially low grade, he became Adjutant Commander and later promoted to Commissar of his unit, while also being the unit&#39;s gun lieutenant. He was described by Sam Carsman in his memoir as someone who maintained good relations with members of his unit. A moment specifically described is when he led his unit on a drunken half-naked midnight drill in the snow, leaving many of the Spaniards there bewildered. From 1937 on, the John Brown Battery (which he was a part of) stayed on the Toledo Front, experiencing little action, until being sent back in 1939 along with the other international brigades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the war in Spain was over, Wiederhorn&#39;s story was not finished yet. Now a hardened veteran, Wiederhorn joined the U.S. army as a 1st Lieutenant, although not much of his story is known during the war. Judging from the 1940 census, it seems that Wiederhorn may have been an Insurance Agent for the rest of his life, and kept close ties with other members of his family, such as Max Wiederhorn, another known communist.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly enough, both he and Max were put on a list of suspected communists in 1956, and as to whether or not they had continued to be communists up to this point, is entirely up for debate. In 1998, aged 86 years old, Samuel Wiederhorn died in the Upper West Side, and was buried in, surprisingly, a graveyard in Calverton, Suffolk County, far from his previously-known family or home.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Milan Zecovic (other spellings include Miljan Zekovi\u0107, Zecevich, Zecevio, and Zecevigh) was born on October 10th, 1911 to Peter and Mary Zecovic in Gary, Indiana and would be raised there at 13-29 Delaware avenue. A city that was founded only a few years prior to his birth, Gary, Indiana experienced rapid growth as it was home to the steel plant Gary Works that his father likely worked at. By 1920 Gary, Indiana was nearly 30% foreign born all likely coming from Eastern European countries in pursuit of industry jobs during the Industrial Revolution. Milan&rsquo;s own parents were immigrants from Yugoslavia which today is split into seven countries. His last name and the fact that he also speaks Russian indicate his family was specifically from Serbia. Zecovic would only complete eight years of primary and middle school before presumably joining the work force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He would later move to New York City and live at 550 West 20th street where he would work as a seaman and be a charter of the National Maritime Union which fell under the Congress of Industrial Organizations. While working there he would make a yearly salary of $85 (about $1400 today). While he lived in New York he would be politically affiliated with the American Labor Party. Milan would be recruited for the war effort by Edward Lasky of unit 140 district 8 member of Chicago Builders. With aid from the communist party, he would arrive in Spain on July 27, 1937 aboard the Agullan citing in the Biografia de Militantes that his reason to join the war was in order to fight against Fascism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Biografia de Militantes as well as the War Commissariat of the International Brigades, that he likely filled up prior to his departure from Spain, also revealed more personal facts about him. He states that he had not taken any classes on politics, and the newspapers he read the most were the Daily Worker, The Communist, and New Masses- all leftist publications. He also stated that the book he used to learn about the communist doctrine was the Fundamentals of Leninism. Many of his personal opinions were demonstrated in these documents too. For example, he states that the 13 Points of the Government of National Union, which outlined the government Spanish Republican Government&rsquo;s Premier Dr. Negrin wished to follow should the republic when the war, was the &ldquo;best thing that could happen&rdquo;. He also goes on to state that in his opinion the People&rsquo;s front policy in Spain is &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; and that he has and never would have any positive interactions with Trotskyists. However, much of what he says in these personal statements should not be immediately believed since many of those fighting on the left who weren&rsquo;t pro-Stalin (Like those a part of the CNT and POUM) would often be purged, so he likely was motivated to ensure nothing he stated could be wrongly interpreted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After his arrival he was detached to an instruction unit for approximately a month and then dispatched to the 24th Battalion-15th Brigade. He would apply for membership in the Communist Party of the USA on November 6, 1937, stating in a letter that he would like to join because he agrees with their program and principles entirely. However, he wouldn&rsquo;t become an officially registered communist until March of 1938 while he was in Catalonia. In the War Commissariat, he states that he intended to specialize in using machine guns and other similar weaponry. The first battle he took part in was the Battle of Belchite, which was a Republican offensive intended to slow down Nationalist advancements in the north which also doubled as the republic using it to decrease Anarchist and POUM influence in the region by bringing in communist troops. It was here on September 5th, 1937, when he volunteered to try and bomb a barricade but was shot in the hand and twice near the left lung. He would spend two months in a hospital in Benicasim then in hospitals at Tarragona and Caldas for an undisclosed amount of time. During this time, his commanders would commend him for his bravery at the Battle of Belchite in December 1937. He would also fight in the Battle of Teruel, which was one of the bloodiest battles and a decisive win for Franco. Zecovic would be promoted to an infantry corporal because of his great fighting during this battle. Milan would also participate in the Aragon Offensive, Catalonia Offensive, and the Ebro Offensive which was the longest and largest battle of the war. He would be injured once more on the Serra de Pandols, likely during the Ebro offensive, on August 27, 1938 where he would suffer getting hit with shrapnel, a shell containing bullets or pieces of metal timed to burst short of impact, from a mortar, a lightweight muzzle-loaded weapon, to his legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;He arrived back to the United States on December 20th, 1938, aboard the Ausonia. However, prior to him leaving Spain his superiors wrote a report on his conduct throughout his service. The report states that although he was a great soldier at the front and preferred to be with Spanish comrades, he was politically very weak unstable, and he talked too much without thought. In a section provided for a supplementary explanation one of his superiors goes so far as to say &ldquo;[Zecovic is] a very contradictory character at all times. Undoubtedly means well but is absolutely unstable on any subject.&rdquo; It seems however that most of the positive comments come from one set of handwriting and the negative from another, indicating that perhaps these two superiors had very different interactions with Zecovic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After serving In Spain, Zecovic would spend a short while in America. Then, he would go on to&nbsp;enlist as a Merchant Marine during World War II. Unfortunately, on December 19, 1941, only a few days after the United States officially declared war on the axis forces, the hog Islander Prusa would be torpedoed into the Atlantic Ocean and Zecovic would die serving as bosun of the vessel.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Sally Selma Kahn was born in Lithuania on May 10th, 1900. She lived in Manhattan and worked at the Bellevue Hospital and arrived in Spain on January 26th, 1937 to serve as a nurse with the American Hospital Unit. Her husband, Jack Liffland, shortly after joined Sally in Spain and was assigned to Transport. Jack&rsquo;s mobility in Transport allowed him to visit Sally often, usually towards the end of her shifts. Though Jack later served as a rank Sargento soldier with the Abraham Lincoln Brigades and fought all over Spain at Jarama, Quinto, and Belchite, the couple found ways to stay close with each other.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nA letter from Jack and Sally, dated January 1st, 1938, detailed their locations as Jack fighting at Albacete, while Sally volunteered at Villanueva de la Jara, only 40 miles north. Only a few weeks after, Jack was re-stationed and reported missing in action during the Ebro Offensive. Sally, hopeful for her husband&rsquo;s return, quickly grew mentally and physically sick as she failed to hear any news. Forced to return home for rest, Sally left Spain for her apartment at 226 East 12th St in the East Village. Not long after, Leo Rosenberg, a friend of Jack and Sally and the recipient of the letter, reached out to Sally. Worried about her sickly appearance and poor eating habits, Leo and his wife offered to take in Sally and care for her at their home. With time, Sally gained back her strength and appeared slightly more cheerful. Soon thereafter, Sally left the couple, and though the date of her death is unknown, the reason for her death was reported as an &ldquo;overtaxed heart.&rdquo; As a close friend, Leo understood Sally as a beautiful and kind soul who exhibited a deep love for humanity, and her husband. Jack&rsquo;s death borne unto Sally a heavy burden of loneliness, sorrow, and despair. However, Sally&rsquo;s legacy as a selfless and passionate volunteer who saved numerous wounded soldiers continues to leave a mark, even after her death.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>In 1915, Moses (Moe) Fishman was born in New York City. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School and enrolled at City College. Due to the financial burden of attending university, Fishman never completed his degree. Before volunteering to join the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, Moe Fishman was part of a number of anti-fascist groups. Fishman&rsquo;s anti-fascist sentiment grew as he researched Hitler and Mussolini. This led him to join the Young Men&#39;s&#39; Hebrew Association. There, he actively participated in the campaign against the United States&rsquo; participation in the 1936 Olympics because it was being held in Germany. As an anti-fascist, he refused to support this, so he later joined the Young Communist League at the 92nd St YMCA. At the time, they were the most active group against the Olympics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt just 21-years-old, Moe Fishman decided to volunteer to fight in Spain in April of 1937. His parents were not supportive of his choice. Moe Fishman had no prior experience in fighting, so it was understandable that his parents did not want him to do this. When Fishman volunteered, he was just working as a truck driver. When he was later accepted to be a part of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade as a truck driver, he called his parents after he made the decision to go. At that point, it was too late for Fishman to go back on his decision. He was committed to going despite his parents&#39; wishes. The&nbsp;only thing that Fishman brought with him to Spain was his toothbrush.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, Fishman did not go directly to Spain. He and others first went to France. There were 40 or 50 other men with him on this journey. While in France, Fishman and a group of 6 other men were hiding with farmers. They used buckets as toilets and were only allowed to go outside at nighttime. These were some of the precautions that they took because they did not want to be caught by other people. When it was safe to leave France, Fishman and the other men who were hiding got on a bus to the Pyrenees mountains. Fishman and the other volunteers would have to cross this mountain on foot to reach Spain.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs they were climbing over the mountains, they were warned about straying from the group. If someone got lost, they were instructed to stay put and wait for someone to come looking for them. In an interview, Fishman recalled that he had heard of people who got lost whose bodies were never found. Eventually, Fishman safely reached Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He recalled that the Republic had bought weapons from Mexico and Czechoslovakia. They also obtained weapons from the Soviet Union. He said that although the weapons were backward compared to that of Hitler&rsquo;s army, they were doable. However, the Republic was outnumbered in terms of weapons and ammunition. In 1937, they were outnumbered by 7 to 1. By the end of the war, they were outnumbered by 11 to 1. Despite the disadvantages that the Republic had, Fishman was eager to fight the Fascists.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis first battle in Spain was the Brunete Offensive. Unfortunately, he was shot in the thigh and severely wounded. He said that if the Republic had not won that battle, it is likely that he would not be alive at the time of the interview. He had to lay on the ground, unable to move the whole day until people could safely transport him to Hospital 16. There, they temporarily set his knee with pins. Fishman was in and out of hospitals the whole time that he was in Spain. He was hopeful that he would be able to recover to see more fighting in Spain but never did. He did, however, recover enough to fight as a merchant marine in World War II.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFishman never regretted fighting in Spain because he was so strongly anti-fascist. In fact, he went on to be a board member of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade organization (VALB). It was the first of its kind as it offered rehabilitation services, such as access to jobs and medical treatment. When the organization was first formed, they faced strong opposition from the government. They labeled it as a communist organization and even passed the subversive activist control act, which specifically targeted members of the VALB. The act demanded that all communists register as so. Failure to comply resulted in a fine of $1000 each day that they did not register as a communist and a year&#39;s worth of time served in jail. However, Moe Fishman and the rest of the board fought this in court and won.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrough it all, Moe Fishman had an unwavering commitment to defeating fascism. In addition to helping the veterans, Fishman also worked closely with the Joint Anti-Fascist Committee to help Spaniards settle into new and better lives. They helped Spaniards go to places in Latin America where they could safely reside and sent them resources like food, money, and clothes. They also sent care packages to jails where Spanish refugees were being held. Fishman worked tirelessly to fight fascism and helped rehabilitate those affected by it.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Thomas Page was born on September 29th, 1909. He only attended 2 years of high school, and as a young African American in New York City, he experienced a lot of difficulty finding jobs. When the Great Depression hit, this struggle became worse, and he resorted to making and selling illegal alcohol. During the Great Depression, the Communist Party worked to organize Unemployed Councils from the third of the population that was jobless. Page joined the Unemployed Councils, protesting for jobless support and more opportunities for workers. As he saw it, &ldquo;it was the Communist Party who did everything, everyone else just talked&rdquo;. Thus, following many involved in the Unemployed Councils, Page joined the Communist Party.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPage seemed to have planned for his involvement in Spain long in advance, obtaining a passport in 1934. At the time, he was living at 14 Randall Court Rockville Center in Long Island, just outside of Queens. He enlisted on February 18th, 1934, and finally went to Spain on March 10th, 1937 aboard the Washington. Once in Spain, he was assigned to drive a truck towards the Cordoba Front. After this mission, he was assigned to the machine gun company in the 20th International Battalion. Afterwards, he joined the International Brigade Auto Park, again as a driver. Due to the high numbers of casualties in the Battle of Brunete, the Washington Battalion and Abraham Lincoln Battalion were merged, forming the Lincoln-Washington (or simply Lincoln) Battalion. This was the Anglo-American battalion Page joined. He became a squad leader within the Battalion, helping to train new Spanish conscripts, as the international battalions became mixed with Spanish soldiers. In the Ebro campaign, he was cited twice for bravery, sustaining two wounds to his shoulder and stomach and remaining in a hospital for much of the rest of his time in Spain. On December 10th, 1938 he took a Cunard Line ship, the RMS Ausonia, back to New York City. Though his time there was under a year, he experienced both the hardship and triumph that was the international battalions in Spain, later recounting in an interview, &ldquo;You give it everything you possibly can. You go out there with no shoes on, you go out there unabrigados(1), you go out there without an overcoat. You wanna win. You don&rsquo;t get cold, you don&rsquo;t get hot, you stick, you stay, you wanna win. That&rsquo;s what it means. I&rsquo;ve been so cold my hands are like, I couldn&rsquo;t open them up, but I didn&rsquo;t mind the cold. You wanna win. Other people, they wanna win. Slept under a little bit of straw, no blanket over you, but you gotta win. Wear a pair of overalls...and it&rsquo;s cold in Spain, it&rsquo;s very cold in Spain, but you wanna win: you&rsquo;re staying.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBack in New York City, he continued to be a stable member of the Communist Party, working as a guard for the Soviet Pavilion at the 1939 World&rsquo;s Fair. He also took up work as a guard for the New York fur market, likely using his experience fighting in the Spanish Civil War as credentials. When World War II broke out, he jumped at the chance to again fight Fascism, joining the U.S. Army. He likely felt the stark difference in experience between this and the Spanish Civil War, as he was again in a segregated environment. He was assigned to Company C, 376th Engineering Brigade, and served in North Africa, France, and Italy. After the war, he took up camera work, working both to repair cameras and as a photographer. During the second red scare and McCarthyism, he was of course questioned and followed by the FBI, but his stubbornness led them to move on. He died in April, 1985.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(1) The phrase is unclear in the interview, but it seems like he is using a Spanglish phrase coming from the word &lsquo;abrigados&rsquo;, which can mean people wearing jackets. Thus &lsquo;unabrigados&rsquo; means jacket-less people, which he translates in the next clause: without an overcoat.</p>\r\n",
