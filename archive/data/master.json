        "data": "<p>Edward K. Barsky was born on June 6, 1895. He grew up in New York, with his parents and five other siblings, and in his youth attended Townsend Harris High School in Queens. Like his father and brothers, who were all doctors, he entered the medical practice. He attended the City College of New York, then the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. After graduating from the College of Physicians, he studied abroad in Europe--he visited Paris, Berlin, and Vienna. When he came back to the United States, he rose from being an intern, then visiting staff, then surgeon at Beth Israel Hospital, which his own father founded many years prior. He joined the Communist Party in 1935. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, Edward Barsky was an assistant surgeon, but he left his position to go help the cause. According to his passport, at the time he lived at 127 West South Street, NYC. He departed January 16, 1937, arriving in Spain in February. He was among the first doctors to travel to Spain to provide medical aid, departing only a few weeks after the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. During the War he helped to create the AMB (American Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy), and was a leading figure in directing staff and setting up hospitals. He was also head of the American Ambulance Unit. At one point, he and his staff were working 50 hours straight. He returned to the United States just once, but during this time he went on a speaking tour and raised &ldquo;hundreds of thousands of dollars&rdquo; and supplies for the cause. When he went back to Spain, he was named Surgeon General of International Sanitary Service, and was responsible for thousands of medical volunteers from all over the world. After the War, Barsky returned to Beth Israel Hospital. He married University of Wisconsin alum Vita Lauter, and together they had a daughter named Angela. He became the chairman of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, providing aid to Spanish Republican refugees who were suffering in the poor conditions of French refugee camps. While he was in office, the Committee raised nearly $400,000 within two years. He eventually found himself being investigated, and in June 1947 was convicted by the House of UnAmerican Activities for &ldquo;contempt of Congress&rdquo;, because the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee refused to turn in their financial records to the government. After three years of appeals, he was sentenced to six months in prison, serving time in the Federal Penitentiary (Petersburg, Virginia), and had to pay a fine of $500. He ended up serving five months. After serving, Barsky had his medical license suspended for six months--despite years of appeals--because, in the words of Judge William O. Douglas, &ldquo;When a doctor cannot save lives in America because he is opposed to Franco in Spain, it is time to call a halt and look critically at the neurosis that has possessed us.&rdquo; However, Barsky received support on an international level, many sending people even writing letters of sympathy-- &ldquo;Eddie is a saint,&rdquo; Ernest Hemingway once wrote to Milton Wolff, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where we put our saints in this country--in jail.&rdquo; Throughout the rest of his life, Edward Barsky remained committed and involved in progressive politics. He was involved in the New York Labor movement, and in the 1960s he served in the Medical Committee for Human Rights, which provided for the medical needs of the civil rights movement in the South. At the end of his life, Barsky was the consulting&nbsp; surgeon at Beth Israel Hospital. He died in University Hospital on February 11, 1975, at the age of 78. (An obituary was written about him in the NY Times that week.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Jos&eacute; Luis Herrera Sotolongo was born in 1909, according to the US Census. Whether this is accurate or not remains to be seen: to this day, there remain multiple discrepancies between records, some stating that by the time of his enlistment in 1937, he was twenty-eight years old, but others stating he was thirty-five. While his exact date of birth remains unknown, he was born in Cuba and immigrated to the US in 1929. Within a few years of immigrating to the US, Sotolongo became an active political participant of the Cuban immigrant community, becoming a member of the Julio A. Mella Club alongside his career as a painter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Julio A. Mella Club was created by Cuban activists and political exiles in 1931 who had left their country in opposition to Cuba&rsquo;s dictator, Gerado Machado y Morales. Otherwise known as the &ldquo;anti-Machado struggle&rdquo;, the Club found support among Harlem&rsquo;s Cuban community, marked for its anti-fascist beliefs and organizing. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, many members of the Mella Club, who had been personally affected by the anti-Machado struggle would comprise one of the many groups of American volunteers who ended up serving in the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sotolongo, alongside many other Cuban peers, was recruited for the Centuria Antonio Guiteras (named for Cuban politician Antonio Guiteras), intended to be a Cuban unit to serve in the war. The US Communist Party paid to equip and transport each group of volunteers. The journey to Spain was long and difficult: the first group of volunteers left on the <em>Champlain</em> on January 5, 1937, where they landed in Le Havre, a town in France. They then took a boat train to Paris, another train to Perpignan, which was on the French border and after a bus ride to cross the Pyrenees, they would take another train to Albacete, Barcelona. While it is not explicitly stated, Sotolongo was most likely to be in this first group of volunteers, as according to his record, he arrived in Spain on February 10th, 1937.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After training with the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, the Centuria Guiteras was integrated into the battalion as Section 3, Company 1. Sotolongo himself would continue to serve with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade at Jarama, Brunete, and Aragon. By his comrades and officers, he was referred to as a &ldquo;good [Cuban] comrade&rdquo; but &ldquo;bad physically&rdquo;, a &ldquo;hard worker&rdquo;, and one that came with a &ldquo;good recommendation from the Brigade&rdquo; with a good &ldquo;political outlook. Thanks to his efforts, Sotolongo would eventually reach the rank of Commandant during his service, although this was short-lived, as not long afterwards, he would be injured at Aragon. After getting wounded, he would wait in Tarazona, a town in Aragon, for a little over a year, before being repatriated back to Albacete in January 1938.&nbsp; After receiving treatment, he would then return to the US on May 27th, 1938 on the <em>SS Cuba</em> to Key West, Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This would not mark the end of Sotolongo&rsquo;s dedication to anti-fascism. In fact, he would go on to serve in WWII, like many other Cuban veterans, choosing to embody his beliefs and values to the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Initially while doing research, I stumbled across another Jos&eacute; L. Herrera Sotolongo who, during the war, notably served as a surgeon for the Spanish Republican Army and was writer Ernest Hemmingway&rsquo;s personal doctor. I initially thought they were the same person, the more I read about Hemmingway&rsquo;s Sotolongo, I realized the details of his life didn&rsquo;t match up with this Sotolongo. They both served in different battalions, performed different duties, were born in different countries (Hemmingway&rsquo;s being born in Madrid, while this Sotolongo was born in Cuba), and Hemmingway&#39;s Sotolongo stayed in Spain a lot longer (he wasn&#39;t injured and didn&#39;t receive repatriation). Side note, but the eerie thing is that when comparing their photographs, the two look very similar!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Pre-war, he worked as a machinist and not in a relationship. He sailed to Spain on July 9, 1937 on the Berengaria. He served as an interpreter for the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion, which was for Canadian volunteers of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Interestingly, Ocasio shows up in the book Cartas desde Elora (Letters from Elora) by Susan Komah. In it, he is shown interpreting between the new Spanish speaking recruits and the English speaking sergeant as this tiny group made their way to headquarters in Albacete. Ocasio said that after getting their info taken down and uniforms, they would be moved to Taraziba de la Mancha for training. He left on December 30, 1938 on the Ausonia. During the 1950s, Ocasio&rsquo;s name appeared on a list of people deemed to still have ties to the Soviet Union, and who would have to show up for a hearing in front of the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws. His name appeared twice because they switched his middle and last name (Garcia and Ocasio), with both names having the same address (43 East 112th Street, NYC). He died in August 1975 in Suffolk NY.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Sol Newman was born on August 15th, 1908. He grew up in Washington Heights, New York, the youngest of five surviving children in a large Jewish family. Early on Newman developed a passionate love of baseball, the Brooklyn Dodgers in particular, and the English language. He wrote plays, poems, and novels all his life and was a gifted storyteller. Newman earned a Bachelor&rsquo;s and Master&rsquo;s degree from Southern Connecticut State College. It was this experience - getting an education surrounded by like-minded socialists and Marxists - that influenced his move back to New York to work as a Taxi Driver and help run the local Transport Workers Union and American Federation of Labor offices. At the same time, Newman had also become a card-carrying member of the Communist Party of the USA where he worked in the agitation and propaganda unit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After hearing news of the Spanish coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat by nationalist forces from friends and co-workers, Newman resolved to go to Spain and sailed aboard the French Line ship SS Ile de France to France on February 20th, 1937. In France, Newman spent a week in Paris pretending to be a tourist, before trekking over the French-Spanish border into Spain, so that he could enlist with the 1st Regiment de Tren, 2nd Squadron. This specific squadron was a unit of truck drivers, transporting Spanish and International fighters to the front.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In letters back home, Newman described his time in Spain as a mixture of relaxation and heavy, fatiguing work. Newman recalls his first week staying in an ex Duke&rsquo;s former villa in Catalonia. There Newman and his fellow squad members threw lavish parties. Right after however, Newman described driving for 50 hours straight in preparation for the battle of Brunete. Newman spent the war transporting troops to and from Brunete, as well as Aragon and Madrid. It was at Brunete where Newman was pictured with some of his squad members and the famous poet and writer Langston Hughes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When not driving or fighting, Newman spent his free time editing a paper for the members of his unit and also wrote poems and stories for various newspapers throughout the US. Newman even got one of his stories, titled Smudge on a Chinese Rug, published in Esquire Magazine while still fighting in Spain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newman went back home in October of 1938 aboard the SS Paris for his father&rsquo;s funeral and proceeded to stay in the United States. He got his old job as a taxi organizer for the Transport Workers Union in New York, and it was here, at a taxi strike in the Spring of 1940, that Newman met his future wife Edie. Once they got married the Newmans moved to New Haven, where Sol got a job working at the Yale University Press, and the New Haven Courier. It was here that Newman was investigated by the US Government for ties to Communism, and actively protested the Mccarthy trials, as well as the arrests of Ethel and Julian Rosenberg. Sol continued to be an ardent supporter of the Lincoln Brigade and its veterans, and a passionate socialist, who was even investigated by the government for his ties to the CPUSA. After a long life in New Haven, Sol and his wife Edie moved to the Meriter Retirement Home in Madison, Wisconsin, where he died on March 9th, 1999, at the age of 90. He is survived by three children, three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren, and even asked that donations be made in his name to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>&quot;A soldier who is politically conscious that he is right and who has a feeling of community with his society...will do his job well&quot; -Bill Aalto<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWilliam Oliver Aalto (preferred to be called Bill) was born in the Bronx on July 30th, 1915. His mother, Elsa Johanna Akkola, was a militant member of the Finnish Communist Party who fled to the United States due to her political beliefs and enrolled in the local communist party. Bright and well-educated from a once prominent landowning family, Elsa had immigrated to New York. Throughout her hard years of domestic service as a single mother in the stratified social hierarchy of America, she retained her staunch beliefs, gravitating towards local communist groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn 1927, Elsa married fellow Finnish immigrant Otto Aalto, the latter becoming the stepfather of 12-year old Bill. While he went through school, Bill took after his mother&#39;s social conscience; running with the Harlem Proletarians (a Finnish youth club) and joining the Bronx Young Communist League. Searching for his moment to make a difference in the world, Bill was struck by a personal tragedy- the death of his half-brother, Henry. In 1935, Bill, aged 18, left home and school, working as a truck driver before deciding to go to Spain and join the International Brigades(IB).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBill (aged 21) arrived in Spain in February 1937, a son of immigrants determined to make his mark upon an unforgiving world. At the time, Soviet military advisors in Spain were putting together their own guerrilla units within the IBs due to a lack of Spanish manpower. Being 6&#39;2 and having studied Spanish before, Bill was immediately recruited as a guerrilla soldier at Albacete, fighting in the Republican irregular forces. He repeatedly volunteered for dangerous operations, often spending weeks behind enemy lines. &quot;I became a guerrilla and stalked,&quot; said Bill in a 1942 interview, &quot;saw no bayonets, met very little machine gun fire, cut the barbed wire.&quot; Trained by Soviet instructors in the use of pressure-sensitive explosives, Bill, along with fellow comrades-in-arms Alex Kunstlich and Irving Goff, Bill worked with a detachment of Spanish guerrillas destroying railroad tracks, bridges, and power lines in preparation of the Republican offensive that began the Battle of Teruel. Their objective to destroy the main supply bridge over the Albarracin River may have been the inspiration for Ernest Hemingway&#39;s novel For Whom the Bell Tolls (though Bill himself was not present during that operation). By late 1937, both Spanish and International irregular forces were brought together as the Fourteenth Corps of the Republican army.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAs the battle for Teruel raged onward with no end in sight, guerrilla operations on the Southern front were greatly amplified. Alex Kunstlich came to command his own unit, with Bill as his second in command. Bill was responsible for all the logistics, supply, and strategic planning of Kunstlich&#39;s operations, in addition to driving the truck taking groups to their rendezvous points. The vast majority of their work remained that of demolitions - as very few guerrilla groups had the supplies to engage in partisan operations. This reflected the Republic&#39;s military weakness as a whole: so crippled by non-intervention it could barely equip its own troops - let alone distribute arms to the peasantry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nDuring the great retreats of 1938, Kunstlich was captured and executed near Granada. Nationalist armies had charged through Aragon to the sea, splitting the Republic in two. To restore morale in the face of this catastrophe, authorities planned a daring action in which both Bill and Irving Goff would undertake. On May 20th, Bill, now a lieutenant, alongside Goff, led a team of 25 guerrillas in a successful amphibious raid at Carchuna, Motril on the Southern coast of Spain, rescuing 300 Republican prisoners. They reportedly cut communication lines, killed the prison guards, and armed the prisoners with hand grenades. &quot;We weren&#39;t a raiding party,&quot; Goff boasted, &quot;We were a battalion&quot;. While the prisoners raced towards Republican lines, the rear guard, consisting of Goff, Bill, and two Spaniards, leaped from the cliff into the Mediterranean. Though both Spaniards drowned, Goff and Aalto used the cover of darkness to reach the shore at the edge of the cliffside, under the enemy camp. Trapped by the presence of enemy scouts, they reportedly huddled in the shallow waters for 48 hours, starving, thirsty, cold, and exhausted. In desperation, they swam to a nearby cave and rested for a day. Finally, they moved to a farmhouse, where they received the hospitality of Spanish peasants before returning to their base. This was the only commando raid ever undertaken in Spanish history.<br />\r\nIn June 1938, Bill was promoted to captain after 17 months of service, later spending three long periods hospitalized with fever, colitis, and chronic malaria. With the war essentially lost, Bill repeatedly wrote to his superiors that they&#39;d all be better off returning to the states and supporting the Republic on the publicity front. He was also concerned his passport might expire - he was still financially responsible towards his mother and half-brother John. It was November when he arrived in a demobilization unit in Valencia, January 1939 when he arrived in Barcelona, and February when he sailed to New York. He had been in Spain for nearly two years.<br />\r\nThough Bill came out of the war with the highest commendations, he did not tell his war stories. He was torn between the justice of the cause and the inhumane violence war demanded. &quot;The war is breaking us,&quot; he wrote, &quot;but also remaking us&quot;. Nevertheless he remained an active member of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB), speaking on behalf of the Republican cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOn January 20, 1939, Bill&#39;s stepfather, Otto Aalto, who had recently separated from his mother, denounced Bill to the FBI, reporting that as a partisan leader of the returning Lincolns, his stepson constituted a danger to the United States. As the Lincolns were already under FBI scrutiny, Bill was recommended for custodial detention. The detention was canceled a few months later when Bill volunteered for the army, as the authorities had decided military service was an alternative mode of surveillance for the Lincoln vets. However, Bill found himself assigned only to most menial tasks. &quot;I&#39;m on the FBI shit list,&quot; he said to a fellow Lincoln, &quot;or else the army&#39;s blacklist&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn 1941, Bill&#39;s former comrade-in-arms, Irving Goff, recommended him for recruitment to the Office of Strategic Services - a force that could utilize the Lincolns&#39; guerrilla experience in conjunction with resistance movements in the partisan war within Europe. However, he was not able to join.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nShortly after returning from Spain, Bill had confided his homosexuality to Goff, who revealed it to the other Lincolns, many of which felt Bill&#39;s sexual orientation could be pose risk to them all. It made them an easy target - not for the clutches of the FBI, but rather for slander by the public and within the army. At the collective request of the veterans&#39;, Bill was transferred to a training camp in Maryland in 1942, where he trained officer recruits in sabotage and demolition. In September 1943, Bill saw an officer drop a live hand grenade and lunged for it. Before he could throw it away, the grenade exploded, blowing off his right hand and part of his forearm. Bill was invalided out of service with a disability pension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nWith the help of his pension and the G.I. Bill, he returned to further his education, studying poetry at Columbia University. At this time, he published several pieces of his writings in the New Masses. After the OSS incident, Bill drifted away from contact with the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBill later traveled to Europe, where he met the poet W.H. Auden. Though sharing the company of other poets, Bill wrote little and gravitated towards alcoholism, frequently entering violent periods. Toward the end of his life, he became the lover of poet James Schuyler&#39;s, and features in Schuyler&#39;s poem, Dining Out with Doug and Frank.</p>\r\n",

Despite his qualifications and good education, Milton&#39;s search for a private job was fruitless, so he took a job in the WPA Teachers Union in New York City.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilton had begun feeling strongly about the protection of security and workers&rsquo; rights. As he participated in strikes and picket lines, he became frustrated with the capitalist system. Once the United States Congress voted to prohibit citizens from selling arms to the democratically elected Republic in Spain, Milton, as a member of the Youth Communist League, left to fight for the Republic. He was one of the thousand Jewish Americans that joined the International Brigades in the fight against Fascism.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnfortunately, there is little information about Milton during the war. His name is not listed on the Scope of Soviet Activities list, so it is likely he used false travel documents under a different name to arrive in Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn June, 1937, Milton was placed in charge of the Runners. The George Washington Battalion was reserved at Morata de Tajuna after fighting from the line at Jarama. On June 30th, the Battalion left to join the 15th Brigade at Brunete.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrior to the start of the offensive at Brunete, the previous Commander Hourihan was transferred and replaced as Acting commander of the Lincoln Brigade by Oliver Law.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt 2:00 A.M on July 6th, the Licoln Brigade left its camp by the Aulencia River until it overlooked the Guadarrama plain over a ridge at 5:30 A.M. It was to act as reserve as the British Battalion launched the first offensive, attempting to cut off the retreat of Nationalist forces. However, this operation failed, as the British Battalion drew heavy fire. The Americans were sent in to relieve the pressure. Due to high casualties, and scorching heat, the offensive was put on halt until the next day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOvernight, the 13th Brigade and the Spanish Assault regiment carried out an airplane bombardment of the town. On July 7th, the Lincoln Brigade made advancements to the Guadarrama River. However, by July 9th, the Fascists were able to set up mosquito nests and trenches along Mosquito Ridge, causing the deaths of countless soldiers and officers, including Commander Oliver Law.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was in the beginning of the Battle of Brunete that Milton died, just a few months after arriving in Spain. The date of Milton Young&rsquo;s death is disputed; most sources claim he either died on July 7th or 10th. Because Milton was shot by a Fascist machine gun, it is likely he died on July 10th on Mosquito Ridge.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Albino Zattoni (1912-1983) was born June 4th 1912 in the small town of Tres in Trentino, an Italian speaking province which was controlled by the Austro-Hungarian Empire until it&#39;s annexation by Italy in 1919. He was probably born to a working class family. His father was David Zattoni, an electrician. Albino Zattoni&rsquo;s left-wing politics and socialist values were likely instilled in him from a young age, as his father was involved with the Socialist Party of Italy. The years of his youth were a time of conflict and political upheaval in Italy as socialists and communists fought in the streets of Italian cities and towns against Mussolini&rsquo;s fascist blackshirts. In 1922, Mussolini came to power in Italy and by 1926 the Socialist Party was banned. Mussolini&rsquo;s assassinations and persecution of Italian socialists which Zattoni and his father would have experienced must have contributed to his strong anti-fascist convictions. In 1929 Zattoni made arrangements to immigrate to the United States, either searching for economic opportunity or political freedom. He arrived in New York City in 1929 at the age of 17 to begin his new life in America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zattoni arrived in New York on the tail end of a wave of massive Italian migration to the US, fueled by Italy&rsquo;s severe rural poverty. He was taken in as a boarder by the Pozza family, a family of two Italian immigrants and their four children who all had crossed the Atlantic to America in the preceding years. He lived for this time on 249 Irving Avenue in Brooklyn, and learned English. Zattoni soon became tied up again in leftist politics. He joined the Socialist Party of the United States and became an organizer for the party . In a short time, he worked his way up to becoming a leader of a local section in the Socialist Party&rsquo;s Italian Federation (the Italian American division of the party), showing once more his commitment to working class politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1936, the Spanish Civil War broke out. Zattoni presumably supported the Republic from the beginning thanks to his anti-fascist beliefs, but he was a late arriver to actually join the International Brigades. He made the decision to travel to Spain only after the brigades had been organized and the stories of international and American heroics at Madrid and Jarama had been publicized. Having been inspired to action, he got his passport on April 3rd, 1937 and set off for Spain on May 12, intending to travel to France and cross the Spanish border. However, both the US government and France adhered to non-intervention, and sought to stop volunteers from joining the Republicans. Zattoni was arrested by French authorities in May and spent a month in a French jail. On his release, he set off right away for Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zattoni arrived in Spain via Massanet on June 14th, 1937. Despite coming from the United States he chose to sign up with the XII brigade, more specifically with the Garibaldi Battalion of volunteers from Italy, along with around 100 other Italian Americans. This might reflect that he continued to identify more as Italian even after moving to America. Italian volunteers like Zattoni were in a tough position because Mussolini&rsquo;s fascist government sent tens of thousands of soldiers to Spain to fight on the nationalist side. This left Italian volunteers fighting on the opposite side to thousands of their people, while their actions made them criminals in their native country. Zattoni himself was wanted criminally by the Italian police.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zattoni arrived with the XII brigade just in time to join in their retreat from Brunete. Following this the XII brigade, as part of the 45th division, participated in the Republic&rsquo;s Zaragoza offensive, the same battle as the XV brigade&rsquo;s failed attack on Fuentes del Ebro. The offensive made some progress but failed its objectives with heavy losses for the Republicans, and the 45th was stopped just 6 km from Zaragoza. At some point, Zattoni learned Spanish as part of his time serving with the Republic. In early 1938, Zattoni&rsquo;s division was moved briefly to Extremadura, before being rushed back to Aragon to stop the Nationalist breakthrough in the crushing Aragon offensive. The Republicans suffered a great defeat, but members of the International Brigade managed to hold the Nationalists back for some time at Caspe. Zattoni fought hard at Caspe and was decorated for his service there. Despite their losses, the XII brigade (and the other brigades of the 45th) managed to rearm to participate in the massive Ebro offensive in summer 1938, during which the Republicans launched their biggest attack yet against the Nationalists. The men of the Garibaldi brigade and the rest of the 45th saw their heaviest fighting of the war, but the offensive ended in complete disaster and the destruction of the Republican army as an effective fighting force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On September 21, 1938, the International Brigades were disbanded. Zattoni and the other volunteers began shipping home. He had fought hard for his beliefs and for Spanish socialism, but as he began the return journey to New York City on December 20th aboard the Ausonia, it was already clear that the Republic was on the brink of defeat. Still, most volunteers could see that the war in Spain was just the first contest in what would become a worldwide struggle against fascism. Like so many other International Brigade volunteers, Zattoni would soon return to war. He enlisted in the US army on February 22nd, 1944 to fight the fascists again. It&#39;s not clear where he fought, but survived the war and returned to New York again by 1945/46. After his fight in WWII, Zattoni slips from the historical records. It can be assumed that he became prosperous enough to enter the middle class. He made enough money to move to Lindenhurst in Long Island, where he lived until his death in April 1983. When he died, Albino Zattoni was 71 years old and he had devoted his entire youth to the socialist cause, for which he fought in Italy, the United States, Spain, and the battlefields of WWII.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Boleslav Wawrzykowski was born on April 17, 1916, in Brooklyn, New York, to Polish parents. It isn&rsquo;t known whether his parents themselves were immigrants from Poland, but this seems plausible, given the year of his birth, as two of the 20 million southern and eastern European immigrants who arrived in the United States between 1880 and 1920. Wawrzykowski completed just one year of high school before dropping out, and at some point during his younger years moved to Poland, where he lived until 1933. He returned to Brooklyn, where he lived on Wythe Avenue in Williamsburg and worked as a radio mechanic, a trade he may have learned in Poland or after leaving high school.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three years later, when the nationalist military forces in Spain staged a coup d&rsquo;etat, Wawrzykowski found a different calling. He was an anti-fascist, and the possibility of fascist rule in another European country was untenable. So, Wawrzykowski, through the Communist party, found himself aboard the <em>Aquitania </em>on June 2, 1937, sailing for Setcases, Spain. Twenty days later, the ship arrived at a port in Catalonia, and Wawrzykowski stepped ashore as an anti-fascist volunteer in the 15th International Brigade, which contained volunteers from the United States, Britain, Spain, and parts of eastern Europe, which suited the trilingual Wawrzykowski well (he spoke, English, Polish, and Russian).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was a member of the Washington Battalion, and first saw action with them at the Battle of Brunete, in July of 1937, a piece in the larger struggle for control of Madrid. Brunete was a town located on the outskirts of Madrid, and the Republican forces attacked it in an attempt to relieve some of the pressure of the Nationalist assault. While initially successful, the Republicans eventually were forced to retreat due to the devastating casualties inflicted upon them. The Washington Battalion alone lost close to half of its volunteers, and was later merged with the Lincoln Battalion, as the deaths were too difficult to quickly replace.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wawrzykowski continued to fight with the new combined battalion, nearly dying at Fuentes de Ebro when a plane exploded in front of his trench, until November 25, 1938, when he returned home aboard the <em>Manhattan</em>. He lived at a couple addresses in the city, staying in Manhattan upon his return, before moving back to Brooklyn, where he shared an address with a friend named Sam Jagan. Wawrzykowski worked at the American Holding Umbrella Company for a man named Charles Laden until Jun 5, 1941, when he enlisted in the US Army to fight in World War II. Curiously, military documents identify him as single, but he claimed in one letter to have a &ldquo;Spanish wife.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Staff Sergeant Wawrzykowski (though he described himself as a &ldquo;Radio Sergeant&rdquo;) initially was stationed in Hawaii, though by July of 1944 he had come back stateside, at that point being stationed at Camp Howze, in Texas. Wawrzykowski remained committed to the Lincoln Brigade, though, writing numerous letters while serving to other former volunteers requesting issues of <em>Volunteer for Liberty</em>, a newspaper run by other volunteers, as well as records from the war. Wawrzykowski also wrote that he felt discriminated against as an anti-fascist and thought that he&rsquo;d been turned down promotions for his beliefs. In one letter, he wondered openly whether he was fighting on the side of fascism or anti-fascism. Wawrzykowski had requested to go to China, and later to Italy, but his requests had been denied.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a member of the 32nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop, Wawrzykowski went to Normandy in mid 1944, where he suffered an ankle injury while taking shelter from enemy fire, for which he was admitted to a hospital. On March 3, 1945, while fighting in Germany, Wawrzykowski was shot in the neck and killed. He was buried at a United States Air Force cemetery in Santa Barbara, California.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Daniel Alvin Pasternack (spelled Pasternak on some records) was born on July 20, 1914. Daniel was born to two Jewish polish-born immigrants, Joseph and Barbara Pasternak, who had immigrated to America sometime in the late 19th or early 20th century: some immigration documents show a certain Joseph Pasternak immigrating to the U.S.A. in 1883, although it is unclear whether he was the same man as Daniel&rsquo;s father.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In the 19th century, Poland as a state did not exist, instead the land was partitioned among multiple Eastern and Central European powers. Judging by the information provided in Joseph&rsquo;s immigration documents, he was likely from the Eastern part of Poland, the region under Russian jurisdiction. This would not have boded well for Joseph and his family, given their Jewish heritage. Among other things, Jews in Poland had to worry about <em>pogroms</em>, slavic riots aimed at Jewish villages, as well as state-induced poverty. Jews were expected to produce young men for the military, pay double the taxes of their slavic neighbours, and were barred from owning land or participating in certain industries, such as brewing. These factors contributed greatly to the decision of Daniel&rsquo;s parents, as well as many other Jews residing in Poland, to immigrate to the U.S. through Ellis Island.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Despite economic hardship and rampant anti-semitism in America, especially during the early 20th century, Daniel was able to gain access to a higher education. This may be due to the fact that his father Joseph himself was educated, or at the very least literate, as indicated on his immigration documents. A U.S. census shows him residing in Suffolk, Brookhaven at 16 years old meaning that in all likelihood he was attending the only high school in Brookhaven at the time: Bellport High School. After high school he studied at Columbia University in New York City. While there is no record of what he studied, there is a record that he went on to be a Mechanical Engineer.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Whether he was radicalized at school, or more likely in university, by 1935 he was a member of the Young Communist League, a youth organization focused on educating future communists and contributing to the working class struggle. It also seems that in 1935 he may have been a member of the Communist Party. The American Communist Party, founded in 1919, saw rapid growth in the 1930&rsquo;s as a reaction to fascist movements in Europe, as well as unemployment due to the great depression. In America the party mainly focused on popularizing unions and helping them negotiate against inhumane employers; however, it also held globalist views and closely followed the rise of fascism in Europe. Eventually, the Communist Party would send thousands of Americans to fight Franco in Spain, Daniel among them.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>On June 5, 1937 Daniel received his first passport, which just one week later he would use to travel outside the country for the first time. Interestingly enough, he listed his secondary addresses in Tampa, Florida. How and why a first generation Polish-American Jewish mechanical engineer held a second address in Florida is a mystery, but given that his primary address was 215 East 18th street, right next to Gramercy Park, it is entirely possible he was relatively well off by his mid 20&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>On June 12, 1937, just seven days after receiving his passport, he set sail on the <em>Georgic, </em>a brand new motorship which regularly traveled between New York, London, Southampton, and Le Havre (a port in Northern France). In 1940, the <em>Georgic</em> too would go on to fight the fascists, only in World War 2, as a troopship. After setting foot on land once again somewhere in North-Western Europe, Daniel proceeded south and crossed the Spanish-French border somewhere around Setcases, a mountainous region on the northeastern side of Spain, not far from Barcelona.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>After Daniel joined the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, an international battalion fighting under the XV Brigade, aka the Lincoln Brigade, his trail went dark. Aside from a brief photoshoot of his brigade, where Daniel appears in two of the pictures, no records are kept of Daniel&rsquo;s time at the front. Even the pictures are misdated, claiming they were taken 6 months after his death.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Daniel resurfaces once again at the Fuentes de Ebro, arguably among the most disastrous battles for the republic throughout the whole war. On October 13th (or, according to one source, 16th), Daniel Pasternack died to aircraft strafing, a common tactic in which a low-flying aircraft is mounted with an automatic weapon which fires at stationary targets. Because Franco&rsquo;s air force was&nbsp; largely supplemented by German aircrafts and pilots, it is likely that Daniel was among the first Americans to be killed by the Luftwaffe, which would go on to battle the British Royal Airforce in the sky. Daniel Pasternack lived a short life defined by one decision and the four months that followed it. This one decision, and the sacrifice that followed, transformed him from an average, if somewhat successful man, to a hero worth remembering and commemorating.</p>\r\n    ",

        "data": "<p>Joseph Martin Sinnott was born in New York City on August 12th, 1892. He lived at No. 1 Christopher Street in Greenwich Village. He worked as a mining engineer in New York City. During 1922, he lived abroad in Spain and France, which, in addition to his identity as a person of Jewish descent, might have served as his motivation to volunteer in Spain. He traveled to many places before he went to volunteer for the Spanish Civil War. His travel records indicated he traveled from Antwerp, Belgium to New York with his wife, Alice Sinnott, on the SS Zeeland in August, 1925. He also traveled from Cherbourg, France to New York on the SS Lapland in October-November 1928. Another travel record indicates that he traveled from San Jose, Puerto Rico to New York in September 1931. On March 12, 1937, he was issued a passport, #374461, which he used to travel to Spain to volunteer. During the Spanish Civil War, he served as an aide to Major Allan Johnson at the Estado Mayor (Headquarters) in Albacete. Johnson served as an operations officer and liaison officer, before being wounded at Jarama and assigned to training new volunteers at the Estado Mayor in Tarazona, Albacete. Sinnott likely served non-combatant roles in war and stayed at Estado Mayor to support the Brigades. After spending a year volunteering in the war, he returned on the Champlain from Le Havre, France and landed in New York on July 20th, 1938. There are little to no records about his life after the Spanish Civil War, but some information shows he didn&rsquo;t stop his travel activities, as another travel record indicates Sinnott returning from Reykjavik, Iceland to New York in October, 1955. He is currently buried at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Upstate New York.</p>\r\n    ",

        "data": "<p>Paul White was born in 1909 in New York City. He spent one year in a New York City high school and two years in the U.S. Army. He then worked on the East Coast waterfront with his friend Joe Bianca and became an official in the Seaman&#39;s Union. He was also a member of the American Communist Party. Upon the outbreak of the coup d&#39;&eacute;tat against the Republic and the Popular Front in 1936, White and his friend Bianca joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade to fight for the Communist Party and against fascism during the Spanish Civil War.<br />\r\nWhite arrived in Spain in May of 1937. He worked under Robert Merrian to organize transporting the Battalion to the Aragon battlefront. In August of 1937, White was sent on a mission to collect the leftover American soldiers in Madrid and bring them to the frontline. White and his partner Edwin Rolfe achieved the near-impossible task and managed to collect full rations and most of the soldiers all within six hour.<br />\r\nAfter the Republic&#39;s defeats in the Argon front, White along with other members of the Brigade left without permission because they claimed that their contracts had expired and they should be allowed to return home. They were arrested and sent back to the frontline, but White stole an automobile to escape towards the French border. White was arrested in Catalonia and David Doran, the brigade commissar at the time, believed White should be executed for desertion. However, Doran was overruled and White was sent back to the frontline.<br />\r\nAfter that incident, White was afraid of fighting in battles again because he felt the Republic was doomed and all the fighting would be futile. In March 1938, White was sent to get supplies and ammunition, but he tried to escape again towards the French border. As White approached the border and saw deserters and troops, his fear grew as he realized that even if he did escape, he would still have to face everyone back home and live under the name of a deserter. At the same time, he heard that his wife had given birth to his son and began to regret what he had done, because he wanted to set a great example for his son and wanted his son to be proud of him. White was arrested soon after in a town near the border, but he viewed it as a way to save him from completely wrecking his life. He then returned to the frontline and confessed his actions. White admitted that his escape to safety would not have protected him from the loss of everything and everyone he loves, and he asks for another chance to serve in his ranks in order to redeem himself and erase this stain on his military record.<br />\r\nIn April, 1938, White was charged with desertion, and his battalion officer John Gates, who was known to be a strict disciplinarian, ordered him to be executed. White&rsquo;s execution was done secretly at night without anyone in the Battalion knowing the detail and reason of it. The next day it was announced that White had been executed as a deserter by the unanimous decision of the battalion, but it was not the case since most of the battalion did know about the execution. This caused huge controversies within the battalion, including White&rsquo;s friend Joe Bianca shouting &ldquo;those sons of bitches!&rdquo; at the commanders. Because of these dissents, it was quickly announced that no further execution would take place within the Abraham Lincoln Battalion. According to John Gates, the day after White&rsquo;s execution, an order came down from the Division to countermand the execution.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Leon Rosenthal was a New Yorker of Jewish descent who enlisted to fight in Spain when he was 26 years old. Little is known about Rosenthal&rsquo;s early life, although he was a registered member of the United Electrical Workers Union, as well as an amateur astronomer. When he left for Spain, he was planning on becoming a scientist upon his return. At the time of his departure, he lived at 380 3rd Ave in Brooklyn, in what is now Park Slope. Funnily enough, where he once lived is now down the block from Battalion Studios, a local recording studio.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    As was common among union members at the time, Rosenthal was most likely a socialist, and certainly a virulent antifascist. However, before he could travel to Spain to fight for what he saw to be a most necessary cause, he had one bureaucratic obstacle to overcome - obtaining a passport. Rosenthal got his passport in late April 1937 and set sail for Spain aboard the Aquitania on May 12th, 1937. Once he arrived, it was not long before he would be put into action on the front.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Most of what is known about Rosenthal can be gleaned from letters he wrote to his wife, Lee, which detail his day-to-day activities, as well as his hopes of defeating fascism and returning home again to &ldquo;start a brand new romance together&rdquo; with his wife, who also volunteered to help the Republic from her home in Brooklyn. These letters have additional historical significance as Rosenthal&rsquo;s descriptions of his experiences working in a Republican propaganda sound truck are thought to be the first of their kind.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Rosenthal&rsquo;s work in the propaganda truck involved printing and distributing leaflets, as well as driving right up to the front and going through a full propaganda campaign with speakers to attract fascist deserters. Him and two others ran the truck, but they were assisted by former deserters and other Spaniards who made speeches throughout the night. The nightly broadcast would start with a playing of the Spanish national anthem, Himno de Riego, followed by a speech by a poet or some other young intellectual updating the whole front on the latest news and speaking of the politics behind the war. After that, the microphone would be handed to a fascist deserter, who would try to convince his comrades to follow him by talking about how much better he was treated on the Republican side. The broadcast would finish with a playing of the Internationale. This tactic was extremely effective, with Rosenthal noting that his team was able to attract 20 fascist deserters in one particularly strong night of work.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Rosenthal&rsquo;s unique line of work made him different from most of his fellow American volunteers, and in fact he was rarely (if ever) actually with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. His truck was itself an independent unit under the 45th Battalion. In August and September of 1937, Rosenthal spent time on the Zaragoza front with the Polish Dombrowski Battalion as well as briefly spending some time with the Italian Garibaldi Brigade.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    After working on the Zaragoza front, Rosenthal and his truck moved to the Extremadura Front. It was there, on February 27th, 1938, that Rosenthal&rsquo;s truck was unfortunately hit with a bomb from a fascist plane. Only one picture of Rosenthal survives today. Interestingly enough, this picture has also been attributed to another Leon Rosenthal, a American volunteer from Los Angeles who served in the Canadian Mackenzie Papineau Battalion under the name Carl Nitzberg. However, per the official archives of the Abraham Lincoln Brigades, the photograph in question is of the Rosenthal described above.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Leon Rosenthal never did achieve his dream of becoming a scientist. Like so many others of his time, the evils of fascism cut his life tragically short.

She was an immigrant from Torntino, Russia, having studied nursing at Jewish Maternity Hospital Training School, and thereafter to be an X-ray technician at Hunter College. She was described as shy, being five feet four, with brown hair and eyes. She was naturalized on June 2, 1931 in the U.S. District Court at Brooklyn. Although her husband, a post office employee named Arthur Peer, warned her of the dangers of going to Spain, she left everything behind to help the efforts, just a month after she had gotten her U.S. passport in 1937. She served with the Medical Services in the Taranc&oacute;n sector. Arriving in Spain on April 11, 1937, the hospital where she was working was bombed several times, and she eventually had her ribs broken by shrapnel. Even though she herself was injured, she helped out others who had lighter injuries than herself in the aftermath of the attack. She had to be sent to Paris to recuperate from her injuries for four months. While on a ship ride to join her in Spain, her husband died due to a heart attack on December 31st. They never got to reunite. In May the following year, she went back to Spain, being responsible for the Hospital de S&#39;agar&oacute; until the end of the war in March of 1939. She was the only American nurse to be cited for bravery by the Loyalist government. Perhaps due to the fact that she participated in the Spanish efforts for freedom, which was linked to Communism, and her birthplace, Sonia&rsquo;s name was listed in the hearings before the United States Senate Committee of the Judiciary on Soviet activities within the United States. She would later marry Alex Kolkin after the war had ended in 1968 in New York City. She died in California.</p>\r\n    ",

        "data": "<p>Rubin (&ldquo;Ruby&rdquo;) Schneiderman was born on April 21, 1915, in Brooklyn, New York. His parents were Rose Zuckerman and Max Schneiderman, and he was Jewish. His father immigrated from Russia, and his mother came from Romania. He had three older brothers: Harry, Louis, and Isidore, and a younger sister: Ruth. He graduated from Osing High School in New York in three years and had no further formal education. According to the Soviet archives, Schneiderman joined the Communist Party in 1932. Possibly as a result of joining the party, he decided to acquire some military training through the Citizen&rsquo;s Military Training Camp at Fort Dix, New Jersey, for four weeks each summer from 1934-1936. CMTCs were military training programs held across the country each summer from 1921 to 1940. They were a legacy of &ldquo;preparedness camps&rdquo; created during World War I but before the US entered it, to train potential officers in the event of war. The camps taught physical fitness, discipline, and basic use of weaponry.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schneiderman was unmarried at the time of the Spanish Civil War and worked as a shipping clerk at a clothing store, organizing the union there. When he decided to volunteer in Spain, he applied for a passport and received passport number 364705 on February 1, 1937. In his passport, he had two addresses listed, one at 1273 Stebbins Avenue, in the Bronx, and the other at 1703 Union Street, in Brooklyn. His address in the Bronx was likely his primary residence. He left for Europe aboard the &ldquo;Paris&rdquo; on February 6, 1937, just five days after getting his passport. He finally arrived in Spain on February 15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schneiderman fought with the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, in the XV Brigade, first with Company 2, Section 1, Group 2, and later with Company 1. Just twelve days after arriving in Spain, he was wounded in action at the failed attack on Pingarr&oacute;n, on February 27, 1937, within the Battle of Jarama. He was soon able to recover and rejoin the fighting. He was injured again at the battle of Brunete. He then became Master Sergeant in charge of Americans at a rehabilitation center behind the front. Due to his injuries, he returned to the US on September 24, 1937, on the &ldquo;DeGrasse&rdquo;, ending his participation in the Spanish Civil War.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding Jewish volunteers in general, it is estimated that 38% of American volunteers in the war and 25% of all international volunteers were Jews. These are relatively large percentages considering that only 4% of the US population and less than 1% of the world was Jewish at the time. But despite the large number of Jews who fought, there has been relatively little mentioned about their impact because of the Soviet role as historians and archivists of the war. The Soviet Union&rsquo;s control of much of the documentation surrounding the war and their anti-Israel stance in later years led to a minimization of the important role played by Jews in the war, especially by American and British historians. In many cases, historians emphasized the socialist beliefs that many Jews held rather than the additional factor that Judaism played for so many in their desire to fight fascism. But despite Jews being ignored internationally, in Spain, there has always been open recognition of the many Jews who came to fight. Moreover, many Jews used aliases to hide their religion, so the real number who volunteered could potentially be much higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After serving in the Spanish Civil War, Schneiderman got married at some point before October 16, 1940, to a woman named Dorothy. He enlisted in the US Army as a Private on May 5, 1943, soon after he turned 28 years old. Despite all of his experience from the Spanish Civil War, he would serve stateside during World War II. It is possible that like many veterans of the International Brigades, he was discriminated against during World War II because of his perceived Communist beliefs. There was no formal policy of discrimination, but many veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion complained about how they weren&rsquo;t given an opportunity to fight in Europe despite their combat experience. In a letter Schneiderman sent in May of 1943 to someone named Jack, (most likely Jack Bjoze, the Executive Secretary of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade at the time), he wrote, &ldquo;I got 128 on the army test and you only need 110-120 for officers school. After the test I got an [...] interview about the [Abraham Lincoln] Brigade and then they put &lsquo;Probable leadership&rsquo; down on my papers which is promising.&rdquo; But despite his qualifications, Schneiderman was sent to an M.P (military police) training center at Fort Ontario. In another letter to Jack, he told him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had some interesting talks with my Louie [Lieutenant] and also the Public Relations and Intelligence officer here at the Post and I told them all about my Spain experience. He seemed very much interested but said I could do nothing about getting out of limited service because my eyes are 20/40 without glasses, but they can&rsquo;t keep a good man down or as the saying goes, &lsquo;talent will win out&rsquo;.&rdquo; In a letter from a year later, Schneiderman wrote, &ldquo;I was DISQUALIFIED for overseas service on two counts, eyes and feet and between you and I, I can&rsquo;t honestly say it was a surprise to me.&rdquo; But he still stayed upbeat, joking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been destined to be an M.P. ever since I stopped a fight between two 9 year old kids, 10 years ago.&rdquo; The thing that stands out the most from Schneiderman&rsquo;s letters is his positive attitude despite being confined to a non-combat role. Schneiderman would serve as an M.P. at various military prisons and POW camps for the duration of the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was released from the army on March 11, 1946. Rubin Schneiderman died on June 11, 2001, at the age of 86, in Charlottesville, Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Saul Wellman is a man who&rsquo;s entire life has been dedicated to revolution. From day one he fought for a better world and in his own words he wanted &ldquo;...things to change, where the playing field is leveled, where equality emerges as a reality...where the horrible things about inequality are eliminated.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWellman&rsquo;s story begins on August 18, 1913, Elizabeth, New Jersey. He was born to a Jewish mother who emigrated from the Russian Empire. His mother was an avid socialist and as Wellman himself put it, &ldquo;I suckled the ideas of socialism at my mother&rsquo;s breast.&rdquo; Shortly after his birth, he and his mother moved to 136 Pulaski Street in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn where Wellman attended Boys High School in Brooklyn. His rapidly developing political consciousness was put into high gear when his mother took him to see Eugene Debs speak when he was 14. From that point on, Saul Wellman&rsquo;s identity as an avid socialist and revolutionary was solidified. However, this was dangerous to be at the time since he grew up in the context of the Palmer raids and the first Red Scare during the 1920&rsquo;s. Wellman saw many of his mother&rsquo;s associates rooted out and arrested by DOJ spies and he himself was arrested when he attended a demonstration of 100,000 workers at Union Square in New York City. This earned him an expulsion from his school and he spent the next few years in limbo. His life found purpose again upon the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Hearing about the abuses of Jews in fascist Germany and the plight of the Popular Front government in Spain, he could not allow himself to stand by. He felt duty bound as a lifelong socialist to prevent the world from falling to fascist tyranny and so on April 28, 1937 he set sail aboard the Normandie, arriving in Spain on May 28, 1937. Being a politically active and knowledgeable individual, he was assigned as adjutant commissar to the Candadian MacKenzie-Papineau Brigade despite being an American himself. Unlike the portrayals of commissars in popular media as detached political bureaucrats who execute dissidents at a whim, the goal of the Republican Commiserate was to be Mother Hens.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Republican army was enthusiastic and patriotic but completely untrained in the ways of war. The commissar was supposed to make up for this and thus had several roles:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Create the spirit of discipline and loyalty to the Republican cause and establish comradery between officers and rank and file<br />\r\n-Be an educator, clarifying all political issues<br />\r\n-Act as a commanding officer during combat and ensure orders were being followed<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWellman fulfilled this role trying to help the material well-being and comfort of his men. He worried about everything from food to sanitation, nagging his superiors to give his men whatever supplies they could give.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWellman found himself in the thick of five major battles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe barely survived being used as a meat shield during Fuentes de Ebro where his brigade was thrown head first into the fascist advance in order to slow it down, muddying the ground with their own blood. Afterwards he took on the role of battalion commissar upon the death of his predecessor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe led his men through the meat grinder of Mas de Las Matas. After this he spent two week chasing down American cigarettes for his men, only to not be given them by the battalion&rsquo;s own inspector general.<br />\r\nWellman strove through the bitter snows of Teruel as it changed hands several times. During the final Republican holdout on El Muleton , he found himself pushed to the limit. Republican forces were on their last legs; they were outgunned, surrounded, stuck on an exposed hill with soil unusable for fortifications. The city below them filled with masses of fascists as Nationalist bombs and artillery blotted out the sun. Wellman ran from position to position as his ears rang from explosions, dust clawed at his throat and every step he took landed in a pool of his comrades&rsquo;s blood. Wherever he could, he led hold out actions, restored machine gun positions and tended to the wounded. Despite Republican valor, the fascist won the battle. This left Wellman to deal with a depleted and demoralized brigade suffering from a lack of supplies. Most notably, the skin of the soldiers started to crack due to a lack of oil so on his own initiative he arranged for several men to take a truck to Andorra and buy some oil. Four days later the men returned. As Wellman himself put it, &ldquo;No words were exchanged except a wink and a red front salute as [they] passed me a handful of nuts to replenish our depleted bodies.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs Wellman chowed down on nuts with his men, he never expected that in just a few days he would find himself fighting in the Retreats. Always running under a hail of fire, never looking back for fear of seeing a Moorish cavalryman behind him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWellman was critically wounded during the failed river crossing of the Ebro river which sealed the fate of the Republic. As fascist victory became inevitable, Wellman found himself on a ship going back to the USA. He arrived on December 20, 1938 aboard the Ausonia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite the failure in Spain, Wellman never gave up. As WWII broke out he signed up for the Army knowing that he must, for a fascist victory now meant fascist victory forever. He joined the ranks of the exalted 101st &ldquo;Screaming Eagles&rdquo; Airborne Division as an automatic rifleman and fought in Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge where he was critically wounded again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUpon returning back to home as a war hero, he got married and moved to Detroit. Here he resumed his political activities. Wellman joined the Communist Party, quickly rising to the top ranks, and took a job as a truck driver where he quickly began unionizing the workers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1949, he learned the hard way that history repeats itself as he was caught up in the Second Red Scare. Wellman was one of the Michigan Six that were tried under the Smith Act. He served six months in prison and broke with the Communist Party after he left as information about Stalin&rsquo;s atrocities reached the rest of the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite this he remained active as the de facto leader of the New-Left movement, having weekly breakfasts with movement figures and protesting wars from Vietnam to Iraq until his death on December 11, 2003.</p>\r\n",

Sachs and his comrades found some food, cans of salty fish, but were unable to drink the water as the fascists had contaminated the wells. Tired, parched and hungry they moved on to Hill 666 a rocky height, completely barren of any vegetation due to the repeated bombardment; not enough soil to dig trenches, the parapets piled-up rock that added to the danger when struck by artillery shells.

He was discharged from the training school on September 13, 1937. Ofsink was known as very reliable among his comrades and had a good record in Spain. According to his superior&rsquo;s remarks, Ofsink was reliable, disciplined and worked well with other men. He was seen as &ldquo;an extra good&rdquo; political influence among his comrades. Ofsink was reported Missing in Action on April 3rd, 1938 near Gandesa. It is presumed that he died on that day.</p>\r\n    ",

A month later, she helped set up the first American hospital in Romeral. In a letter from July addressed to &quot;T,&quot; she states, &quot;My first operating room was set up in Romeral, and what a problem! No running water; water had to be carried in the house after we had pulled it up from a well, and then was placed in tanks for scrubbing. Water had to be carried in for the autoclaves, etc. Our autoclaves are heated by prima stoves which run on kerosene, and you can&rsquo;t imagine how much work there is attached to sterilizing and keeping things clean. We spend hours trying to figure out a way in which to sterilize our goods so that things come out dry. We have not given up trying although we have been at it five months.&quot; Most of her letters were sent to her family from Spain, and usually depicted detailed descriptions of her work and surroundings. She served throughout Spain, setting up operating rooms in Villa Paz, Teruel, the Aragon Front, Belchite, Gandesa, and Cuevas Labradas. Regarding her experience treating the troops, she once stated, &quot;What right had I to be frightened? I who have just tasted what they have long lived through? With my heart pounding almost as loudly as the roar of the motors aboe, I spoke to them. I told them they must be brave.&quot; These statements were often published in radical papers and helped label the American Medical Brigade members as heroes. Upon her return to the United States in 1938, Taft continued to communicate with individuals in Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a documentary called &quot;Into the Fire: American Women in the Spanish Civil War,&quot; another volunteer named Helen Freeman recalled, &quot;I met some friends and went to a meeting. And the meeting was called to aid Spanish democracy. All the different unions were supporting the group. They asked for nurses and doctors and volunteers to go to Spain. And so, I volunteered. They called us in and started organizing the trip. Meeting with the different people who were going, like Fredericka Martin, Lini DeVries, and my friend Anne Taft, who graduated from the same school that I did. People had to resign from their jobs. Most of us were young nurses. And so, that&rsquo;s why they had meetings to teach the young people what to expect when they get over there.&quot; She was documented to be the head nurse later on in her life and continued similar activities even after returning to New York by serving as a spokesperson for a fundraising drive that sent an American relief ship with food, clothing, and supplies to Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnne Taft married Dr. Leon F. Muldavin in New York City, and remained with him in the city throughout their lives. She passed away in 1990 in New York City.</p>\r\n",

At some point in his life, he came to live in New York City (specifically, 228 West 111th Street in Harlem), and at the age of 24, he decided to enlist to go fight in Spain. After obtaining a passport on March 29, 1937, he left New York aboard the Aquitania (an ocean liner that was sailing from New York to Cherbourg and Southampton) just 2 days later. Following his arrival in Spain (presumably coming from Cherbourg along with several other volunteers who also departed New York aboard the Aquitania on March 31st) in April, he eventually became the secretary of his company within the Lincoln Battalion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn July 6th, 1937, the Lincoln, Washington, and British Battalions were sent to serve as part of the offensive at Brunete against the Nationalists. They were sent to capture the town of Villanueva de la Ca&ntilde;ada and ended up spending the entire day engaged in a brutal struggle that was ultimately inconclusive. They were sent back to break the stalemate at the town the next day, and although they did manage to take the town, they suffered heavy casualties. Among those casualties was Van der Roest, who was killed during an attack by Nationalist aircraft. His demise was personally witnessed by Carl Syvanen, a fellow member of the Lincoln Battalion who would go on to recount the story in the Finnish novel Meid&auml;n Poikamme Espanjassa (Our Boys in Spain).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInterestingly enough, Van der Roest is claimed as a member of both the Lincoln Battalion and the Canadian-centric Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion: he was killed before ever getting the chance to join the &quot;Mac-Paps&quot; (as Syvanen later would) but is still listed among those Canadians who gave their life in service of the Republic (it is unclear whether or not he would have wanted to be remembered as a Canadian or an American, but his hometown is still remembered as New York).</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Clara Leight was born March 10, 1900 in Russia. She moved to the United States when she was nine years old as a Russian-Jewish immigrant. It is unclear how she lost her father, but Leight was raised only by her mother and grew up hearing Yiddish folktales from a book dating all the way back to the 16th century. Her mother used these stories to encourage compassion towards others in their community. Leight&rsquo;s family was filled with suffragists and labor organizers. They inspired her to fight for what she believed in and to support different causes. When Leight got older, she used what her mother had taught her and studied to become a nurse at Bellevue Hospital. She successfully graduated in 1927. Leight got her passport on May 4, 1934 so that she could serve in the Spanish Civil War. She became a nurse in the army in March of 1937 after she sailed aboard Ile de France. Her family supported Leight&lsquo;s decision when she volunteered. In fact, she received much support and encouragement from her loved ones back at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nWhen Leight was in the army, she was single, and her address was 531 East 84th Street in New York. She served with the Republican Medical Services at Villa Paz hospital. Leight was also part of the American Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy (AMBASD). As a nurse in the war, she served as an interpreter and colleague to a nurse named Margaret Sanger. As they visited hospitals and clinics in the Soviet Union, Leight remarked how condoms and other such things were not allowed to be distributed by Sanger. She noticed the backward ways of the place she was born in. Leight came from a background of suffragists, so she understood the sexism displayed in those actions. Eventually, she was promoted to first lieutenant in the Federal Government Nursing service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nLeight returned home in August, 1937 aboard the Queen Mary. Despite serving in the war, and supporting her country once, she later served in the army as a nurse once again for the US in World War II, from February 3, 1943 to December 20, 1945. Leight&rsquo;s determination to support causes she believed in and serve her home continues to inspire many, even today. Leight passed away on March 17, 1987 from natural causes.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Rebecca Durem Schulman was born in Dayton, Ohio&mdash;an industrial town considered the &ldquo;birthplace of aviation&rdquo;&mdash; on January 8th, 1911. She was a Russian-American Jew; when she was 4 years old, her mother took her to visit her grandmother in Russia. The visit was unfortunately timed, as the raging revolution occurring in Russia at the time trapped the Schulmans in Russia for four years, during which Schulman&rsquo;s father sent his wife and daughter money to keep them alive. After she and her mother returned from Russia, the Schulman family settled in Brooklyn, New York, on 2168 77th Street (a part of Bensonhurst). Graduating from nursing school in 1931, Schulman served as both a private and a hospital nurse. At Beth Israel hospital in midtown Manhattan, which was founded 40 years earlier to serve Jewish immigrants, Schulman worked with Dr. Edward Barsky, an organizer for medical services in Spain. Dr. Barsky made Schulman aware of Spain&rsquo;s need for medical resources and personnel. Although, in an interview years after the Spanish Civil War, Schulman said she was never &quot;very political,&quot; she believed in Spain&rsquo;s right to a democratically elected government. When Dr. Barksy asked her to work in Spain, a &ldquo;restless, adventurous,&rdquo;travel-eager, twenty-six-year-old Schulman said &ldquo;yes, because they needed nurses and [she wanted] to help right a wrong.&rdquo; While serving at Villa Paz, the American Base&rsquo;s Hospital in Saelices, Schulman met Abraham Lincoln Brigade volunteer Ramon Durem, who was recuperating from a leg wound. Durem was a notable poet; Schulam married him in Aranjuez on March 17th, 1938. After Republican armies were forced to retreat from Villa Paz after an aerial bombing of nearby Urrea de Ga&eacute;n, Schulman was transported to Barcelona by train. On May 11, 1938, she returned to Brooklyn aboard the Normandie due to pregnancy. Reflecting on her experience in the war, Schulman said &quot;I blossomed in Spain. Everyone was your Camarada. We were all together.&rdquo;<br />\r\nSchulman died on August 17, 2002, in Claremont, California at the age of 91. She is survived by three daughters, Dolores&mdash;the daughter she gave birth to after returning from Spain and named after Dolores Ibarruri&mdash;Pilar and Vita, four grandchildren, five great-grandchildren, and one great-great-grandchild.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Edna Drabkin Romer was a young, Jewish member of the Socialist party when she enlisted to serve as a nurse in the Spanish Civil War. She and her husband, both self-acclaimed working people, made the journey from New York City to Spain on July 18th, 1937. Upon arrival, her husband immediately headed to the front lines. With credentials and training from the Metropolitan Hospital of New York, Edna worked as a nurse for the American Medical Bureau. She aided the injured and saved lives in the American Hospital, situated in the Palace of Villa Paz in Saelices, Cuenca, as well as with the Auto-Chir on the Aragon Front, the 35th Division on the Teruel Front, and in field hospitals along the Ebro River.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>She described her duties as meaningful, but less than glamorous in letters to her friends in the States. The weather was harsh, often calling for layers of sweaters and sheepskin jackets to ward off the cold. She and her friends used their breaks &ndash; on the rare occasion they could get one &ndash; to search for a water bottle they could heat, but even then they had no fuel to keep a fire. Through it all,&nbsp; even with ten to fifteen hour shifts and constant stress, she found value in the work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The hospital held what she called &ldquo;fiestas,&rdquo; inviting in Spanish peasant farmers, or campesinos, to drink, dance, eat, and listen to political speeches. There were posters for the cause on every wall, games like chess and checkers if they could find the time, and a library with not nearly enough intellectual books to be read.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Romer especially loved the people and the culture. She treated mostly French and Spanish soldiers, who she thought were short-tempered, but always showed mettle. French, Spanish, and the occasional German became required communication skills, and she relished the moments she found to speak English to a fellow nurse or a soldier seeking medical attention.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>When interactions with soldiers and the Medical Bureau&rsquo;s subpar library failed to satisfy her intellectually, she would wait for a visit from someone who could. Ralph Bates, Ernest Hemingway, Martha Gelhorn, Dorothy Parker, and Alan Campbell all visited field hospitals where she served, touring the grounds and offering news about the world outside Spain. Romer even spoke to US Congressmen John Bernard of the Farmer-Labor Party and Jerry Joseph O&rsquo;Connell of the Democratic Party. They gave speeches about FDR&rsquo;s Neutrality Act, calling for it to be overturned as the beginning of an effort to establish a classless society in Spain. Romer thought they were sincere and revolutionary.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In 1937, right in the thick of the war, she wrote a letter home asking for news about the New York elections. The Nationalists had gained most of the Basque region and were pushing Republican forces further towards the Ebro, and Romer wanted to know about Socialist Harry W. Laidler&rsquo;s progress in his run for Governor of New York. She asked whether the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) was still going strong, and whether the Socialist party had gained any traction nationally in the United States. This was her cause.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Her husband, Samuel Romer, served with her, though he was captured by nationalists and spent seven months in a prison camp before being released in exchange for Italian soldiers. After he returned from Spain, he wrote about his experience in a 1938 edition of <em>The Socialist Review</em>, where he described himself and Edna as genuine socialists, whose hearts demanded that they fight in Spain. He said they had no regrets.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Despite the grueling work she performed during the war and her dedication to the Socialist cause, Romer was repatriated to the States fourteen months after arriving. Her superiors thought her insufficiently devoted to the cause of the Popular Front government. They worried she would be vulnerable to enemy subversion because she lacked passion and resolve.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>She returned to the U.S. aboard the Normandie on September 26th, 1938. One of her deepest regrets was not chronicling her time in Spain. After her husband&rsquo;s sudden heart attack in 1965, she held memories of their efforts in Spain close to her heart. Romer passed away at the age of 66 in 1979 and was buried in Florida.</p>\r\n    ",

        "data": "<p>Milton &ldquo;Milt&rdquo; Wolff was born on October 8th, 1915, to a Jewish family in Brooklyn. His parents were Yiddish-speaking immigrants from Hungary and Lithuania who made their home in the vicinity of Bay Parkway and Kings Highway. While he lived in Brooklyn, he first resided at 1628 West 5th Street, and later at 74 Quentin Road. He was born into the Great Depression, and he dropped out of the (long-defunct and seemingly obscure) New York School of Commercial Art at age 15 after only a single semester. Wolff then joined the Civilian Conservation Corps, where he was transformed from a shiftless urban teen into a forester. He loved the exercise and the sense of camaraderie between his fellow members, and he was trained in first aid. But eventually, his rosy perspective soured as he witnessed institutional bureaucratism and red tape lead to unsafe working conditions which resulted in the death of one of his friends. He began protesting the CCC&rsquo;s management and conditions, and for this he was expelled. It was during this time that his political consciousness and penchant for organized resistance against oppression began to take shape.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter bouncing around Brooklyn with his friends for a while, he found work at a hat factory in Manhattan&rsquo;s Garment District. Following many colleagues in his social circle, he joined the Young Communists League in April of 1936. Wolff described his political development at the time as &ldquo;rudimentary&rdquo;. Yet by February 20th, 1937, he had set sail for Spain when a YCL organizer asked for volunteers. He told his mother that he was sailing over so he could work in a Spanish factory to free up manpower for the armed workers&rsquo; movement. He secured passage on the Ile de France, and sailed from New York to France. By March 7th, 1937, he had crossed the Pyrenees and reached Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDrawing from his earlier CCC experience, Wolff started out as a medic, and his initial work consisted of carrying water and stretchers. He initially considered himself a pacifist. However, he was soon inspired by the African-American commander of a machine gun unit, and he soon petitioned to serve in a machine gun company. As part of the Washington battalion, he first saw action at Brunete where he narrowly avoided death even while he saw men inches away from him brutally gunned down.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter this engagement, Wolff went on leave in Madrid. During this time, his captain pointed him towards the Cafe Chicote where he first met Ernest Hemingway. Wolff first met Hemingway after seducing his mistress. Hemingway supposedly did not mind this, but he was far more offended when he learned that Wolff had no idea who he was. Initially, Wolff wrote to a friend that Hemingway was &quot;childish in many respects&quot; and that he &quot;want[ed] very much to be a martyr&quot;. He summed up his first thoughts on Hemingway with a quip: &quot;So much for writers. I&#39;d much rather read their works than be with them.&quot; In 1940, when Hemingway published For Whom the Bell Tolls, Wolff later resented his depiction of Republican-sympathizing villagers killing fascists as he thought it overly murderous and bloodthirsty.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter returning from leave, he fought on the Aragon front leading a section of the machine gun company. After performing valiantly despite major losses at Belchite and Quinto, he commanded the machine gun company at Fuentes de Ebro. By January 1938, after not even a single full year in action, he achieved the rank of captain. Wolff drew comparisons to Abraham Lincoln himself, due to his tall and gaunt physique as well as his personal gravitas and strong leadership skills. That March, the base HQ was bombed and the leadership slaughtered. It was at this point that Wolff became the commander. He was preceded by 4 commanders KIA and another 4 seriously wounded. He directed what remained of the battalion through a treacherous retreat from deep behind what had become enemy lines, and traveled alone for six days to the Ebro where he swam across. While rebuilding the battalion as its newly minted commander, he was immortalized in Hemingway&#39;s 1938 Spanish Portraits journalistic series of press vignettes on fighters for the Republican cause. A famous photo of Wolff and Hemingway, taken by photojournalist Robert Capra, was included in the article. A few weeks later, this photograph found its way into the Yiddish newspapers where his mother was alerted to the true nature of his activity in Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the summer of 1938, Wolff led the consolidated Lincoln-Washington battalion back across the Ebro where they held the lines at Hill 666 and held off the fall of Valencia until the Republic ordered the withdrawal of foreign troops later that year. In a ceremonial transfer of authority, Wolff ultimately attained the rank of Major in the Republican Army. By December 15th, 1938, Wolff and the last volunteers made it back to New York City, where Wolff laid a wreath to honor the dead outside Madison Square Park.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter returning to America, Wolff continued a life of service and activism in the name of communism and anti-fascism. Wolff was a beloved figure in Spain, where he returned to visit multiple times. He reminded Spaniards that if they got into trouble in the future, to &ldquo;give me a call&rdquo;. Even after the war&rsquo;s official end, he led street protests in New York City urging the government to lift the Spanish embargo and aid Spanish refugees trapped in neighboring France who were held in what amounted to concentration camps. France threatened to deport the refugees back to Francoist Spain, where they would be treated as enemies of the state and likely tortured or executed. Wolff and other veterans protested outside the French consulate in 1940, and Wolff served 15 days in jail for his activities. He never gave up the fight to free Spain. Wolff was an active member of the U.S. Committee for a Democratic Spain for decades, where he lobbied against political recognition of and treaties with the Franco regime, provided aid to political prisoners and their families, and pushed for democratic reforms. During WWII he was turned down for combat duty due to concerns over his leftist politics, so instead he served with the Office of Strategic Services (which would later become the CIA).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrough a friend of a friend from the war, Wolff came into contact with William Donovan who was selected by President Roosevelt to head the OSS. He assisted Donovan with a project to recruit Spanish Civil War veterans into the British intelligence apparatus. This project began in Spring of 1941 and continued until Pearl Harbor. Then, Wolff directly offered Roosevelt the services of the VALB to the American war effort. This was declined, so Wolff continued recruiting veterans for secret projects in Italy, North Africa, and Normandy. Wolff officially enlisted in 1942, but was quickly marginalized and denied the opportunity to participate in a combat role. He was denied the opportunity to attend Officer Candidate School. In order to try and get a transfer, Wolff then traveled to Burma where he helped the war effort in the Pacific Theater. The OSS then sent him back to Italy where he formed an underground communist partisan network with the help of multiple other Lincoln veterans he had previously embedded. Wolff graduated from parachuting school, which he considered to be one his proudest achievements. He was sent by air into southern France on a top secret mission, but while he was there, he discovered an underground network of Spanish resistance members plotting to invade Spain and overthrow Franco. When Wolff petitioned the OSS to aid them, he was prematurely recalled from his assignment and sent back to America.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrough his stature in the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) he remained a prominent advocate for Spanish Civil War veterans and the causes they espoused. During the Cold War he was the public face of the VALB, where he and Moe Fishman presided over the defense of the Lincoln veterans before the Subversive Activities Control Board in 1954. He and many fellow veterans from New York were lifelong Brooklyn Dodgers fans, and they pushed for integration in the MLB by publicly supporting the inclusion of Jackie Robinson and other black players. He led protests against the Vietnam War and even personally offered Ho Chi Minh VALB military support during their conflict against South Vietnam, which was politely declined. He championed removal of the Cuban embargo, and to this end he helped provide medical aid to a children&rsquo;s hospital in Havana. During the 80s, he and the VALB sent ambulances to the Sandistinas as the Reagan government was funding the anticommunist insurgency.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilton Wolff passed away on January 14th, 2008 at the age of 92 due to congestive heart failure. He is survived by his two children, Susan and Peter, from his first marriage with Anne Gondos. Additionally, he has at least four grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Herman (or Hy, as he was called by his friends, which was short for Hyman) Hollander was born on the 14th of May, 1914 in the city of Lemberg (modern day Lw&oacute;w), Poland. While he was ethnically Polish, the brief years that he spent in that city did not define him. Even during the sunset of his life&mdash;spent in Sunrise, Florida&mdash;he identified as a proud and true New Yorker, specifically from his beloved Lower East Side. It was in this neighborhood that he began his political journey, met his lifelong friends and comrades, and found the fire and determination to be a fighter for his beliefs regardless of age.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hy&#39;s early childhood was marked by an intrusive and disruptive disparity between the different spheres of his life. During his time in Poland, he can remember his grandmother telling him that, &quot;the revolutionaries are in town,&quot; in reference to the Bolsheviks. These loaded words, and the bodies hanging from the gallows that accompanied them flew over Hy&#39;s 6 year old head, but left him asking questions. These sights of tragedy followed Hy and his father even after their move to the States in 1920 after the death of Hy&#39;s mother. They were driven by this tragedy, the prevalent discrminiation towards Jews in Poland, and the promise of a better life. While Hy and his father did move into an ethnically diverse Williamsburg that accepted them, they could not escape poverty&#39;s grasp. One of the defining images from Hy&#39;s childhood that would go on to influence him for the rest of his life was of people in his neighborhood scrounging through barrels and garbage pails for food during the early 30s. Before those teenage years, Hy had always asked why things like war and hunger had to exist, but after his maturation, he was suddenly driven by the horrific images of his past to act. To help. To do his part.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hy was an excellent student, but often found the schoolroom itself lacking for mental stimulation. This would lead him to the Brooklyn Public Library, where he would spend hours reading about his passions&mdash;history and geography&mdash;and the world&#39;s great revolutions. After his visits to the library, he would hear a monthly speaker that would appear on the corner of Varet Street and Graham Avenue near his neighborhood. This man discussed Soviet Russia and its tenets: peace, bread, employment, and equality. Through this speaker, Hy joined the Youth Branch of the Downtown Workers&#39; Club, which finally led him to the Youth Communist League, or YCL. Herman eventually rose to become the President of the Youth Section, and provided food and shelter to the homeless and disadvantaged youths, regardless of the police&#39;s frequent attempts to disrupt him and his friends. He participated in demonstrations for unemployment insurance and for food aid. This ragtag group of YCL boys were beaten by the police, but none of them cared. For them, the League wasn&#39;t as much about a political ideology as it was about helping people, and doing the right thing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was out of this burning conviction that Herman found the need to go to Spain. He hated what Hitler was saying, and was also able to sympathize with the victims of Pogroms and Concentration Camps. He feared that if Hitler wasn&#39;t stopped in Europe, &quot;then instead of Normandy, there would be fighting in Coney Island and Brighton Beach.&quot; Hy felt that he was bound to his duty because he was a member of the human race, and because he believed in a government without oppression that was controlled by the people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After an 11-day voyage aboard the German ocean-liner <em>Berengaria</em>, during which he had his 23rd birthday, Hy disembarked at the Hague and made his way to Paris. After a series of train rides and nighttime walks through villages, he crossed the Pyreenees. After their descent, and arrival in Spain, he and his troupe were greeted by the locals with hospitality and&mdash;more importantly&mdash;wine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hy&#39;s tour in Spain lasted for 14 months, during which he served in the Jarama Valley, Bruneti, Teruel, Albacete, and others. He said himself that being in battle felt like, &quot;the world was coming to an end.&quot; The noise was beyond anything that he had ever experienced, and the sight of what he called the &quot;Lower East Side Boys&quot; being felled beside him was often too much to bear. Two major anecdotes stand out when it comes to his time on the battlefield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first reflects the closeness of the Lincolns, both on the field and off. A man named Jack Weiss, who was Herman&#39;s cousin, served with Herman during the Bruneti campaign. He was injured in the field and was being dragged back behind the lines on a litter, bleeding profusely. He happened to pass by Herman, and when he saw him, Jack shook his fist at Hy as best he could and said, &quot;if you tell my sister that I was wounded then I&#39;ll get even with you.&quot; Herman responded by calling the man crazy, and told him to get some rest while chuckling. Jack fortunately made a recovery from his injury, albeit with a bad leg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second was tragically all too commonplace. A friend of Hy&#39;s, named Sauly Bernbaum, was a Captain in the John Brown Battery. Sauly was greatly admired by Hy, particularly his sense of duty and responsibility as a leader, and the extent to which he acted on these convictions. Sauly never ran away, and never put himself first. The two men served together during the Belchite campaign, which was characterized by the vicious covering fire of Nationalist snipers to slow the Lincolns&#39; advance. During one such push, the group had to run through open ground, and one of their comrades was shot. He was still alive, but could no longer run with the company. Sauly, out of a sense of compassion or duty or both, turned and tried to help the fallen man. In vain he pulled at the near-deadweight, hoping against hope that this man, his friend, would not be left in no-man&#39;s land under withering fire. His fellows, Hy among them, looked on in pain for a moment, before one broke the silence and simply said, &quot;you have to go on.&quot; This is a phrase that Herman would never forget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would stay burned in his mind for years to come, and after once again serving the US in the Second World War as a member of Signal Radio Intelligence, it would shape his career choices. Herman became a leader in movements for various unions in New York City, chief among them being a union for Taxi drivers, which began in 1949. He worked with notables such as Harry Van Arsdale, and got Lincoln Veterans jobs by collaborating with Moe Fishman, the General Secretary of the Brigade&#39;s Veterans&#39; Association. After moving to Florida because of his wife&#39;s health, he joined the National Council of Senior Citizens, and continued to do good work for the community into his own seniority.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Herman Hollander lived an amazing, full life. He rose out of a poor, first-generation immigrant family of Polish Jews to become somebody who made a great difference. He didn&#39;t die a wealthy or famous man, but Herman possessed something that few do. He was proud of his life&#39;s work, and had truly done his part. When asked what he thought about the Spanish Civil War and its effect on his life, he said, &quot;There&#39;s no doubt about it in my mind, and in my heart, what I did 50 years ago is the most beautiful thing that any human being could do. It was a just cause, it was the right thing to do.&quot; He put his life on the line for what he believed in, and helped a cause that would, finally in 1975, bear fruit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Herman was able to see a democratic Spain, and made a trip there in 1986. Amidst all the talks he attended and the gifts he was given, one moment stood out to him as perhaps the best moment of his life. One day during the trip, he and some other veterans saw a protest of mostly young Spanish people moving past the outside of their hotel. The elderly men raised their arms in the Republican Salute, and to their surprise and satisfaction (in Herman&#39;s words) &quot;got it right back.&quot;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Born in 1904, Alvah Cecil Bessie was the second son of Adeline Schlesinger and Daniel Nathan Cohen Bessie, a successful New York City businessman. He was raised in Harlem and grew up attending public school, ultimately matriculating from DeWitt Clinton High School (then an all- boys school located on Tenth Avenue between 58th Street and 59th Street in Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen) in 1920 to Columbia College, where he earned his degree in English in 1924. After his older brother died and left the Bessie family with significant financial baggage, the younger Bessie was for the first time free of his commanding father&rsquo;s clutches and free to pursue what he wanted. After a four-year stint trying his hand at acting in the New York theater scene and subsequently recognizing his limited capabilities, Bessie decided to pursue writing. In 1928 he took a yearlong trip to France and translated avant-garde French literature while writing, and eventually publishing, his first short story &ldquo;Redbird.&rdquo; He returned to the United States in 1929, and over the following six years was married, moved to Vermont, and had two sons. During this time, as he published numerous stories, essays, and reviews for various magazines and newspapers, Bessie was also writing his first novel Dwell in the Wilderness (1935), which won him a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1935. This was also when he began studying Marxist theory, which, when coupled with his move back to the city in 1935, led to his joining the Communist Party in 1936.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once back in New York (and living at a new residence: 164 Lexington Avenue in Kips Bay, according to his 1937 passport), Bessie was hired by the Brooklyn Daily Eagle as an editor for their drama and book sections. His time there was ripe with disagreement, as his radical stance on several issues (most notably the Spanish Civil War) did not mesh with his superiors&rsquo; conservative views. The final straw, Bessie&rsquo;s support of French novelist, aviator, and activist Andre Malraux&rsquo;s efforts to organize and send a group of French flyers to help the Spanish Republic, led to his resignation from this post in 1937. Shortly thereafter, he found a new position working for the Spanish Information Bureau, a New York propaganda agency of the Spanish Republican government whose purpose was to distribute promotional materials that contained information directly from Spain in order to spread word about what was occurring abroad. During this turbulent period, Bessie&rsquo;s marriage also began to dissipate, and he was shortly thereafter divorced from his wife.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After working for the Spanish Information Bureau all summer and consulting his ex-wife (who told him, &ldquo;If you have to do it, do it&rdquo;), Bessie decided, &ldquo;Hell, I want to go there!&rdquo; and sailed to Spain to join the International Brigade in January of 1938. Much like many of the other Brigade volunteers, Bessie saw the effort not only as a struggle for Spain, but also as a larger fight against fascism and what he deemed the &ldquo;eternal enemy&mdash;oppression.&rdquo; Indeed, years after the war he would say, &ldquo;when I enlisted in the International Brigade of the Spanish Republican Army, I was convinced that I was helping to preserve my country from international fascism.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Bessie had earned his pilot&rsquo;s license before sailing over with the intention to become a flyer, he was put on the front lines with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. He, along with the other new arrivals, quickly discovered that the war effort was not nearly as glamorous as they had envisioned. As he moved with the Brigade towards the Ebro River, Bessie wrote of a lack of adequate supplies (whether it be equipment, medical kits, or food), a near-complete lack of discipline, and seeds of self-doubt, wondering in his diary, &ldquo;Will I be a coward?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bessie soon arrived at his answer when the Lincoln Brigade accidentally stumbled upon a Nationalist camp and had to flee for their lives. For several days, he and three companions straggled towards the Ebro River, whose far bank promised refuge and comrades. However, once there he found similarly destitute conditions amid streets &ldquo;jammed with ragged and demoralized men, wandering idly about.&rdquo; When word came of Nationalist tanks on the way, Bessie and the scraggly band of volunteers made their way to a town further eastward, which they found had at least some semblance of order. Here, they received copies of the International Brigades&rsquo; publication, The Volunteer for Liberty, for which Bessie was a correspondent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Franco&rsquo;s troops advanced towards the Mediterranean Sea, Bessie and the rest of the Brigade knew their cause was becoming more hopeless by the day unless foreign nations provided much- needed aid. Alas, they did not, and by the summer of 1938, Franco&rsquo;s forces controlled most of Spain, with the notable exceptions of Madrid, Barcelona, and Valencia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dire circumstances and dearth of supplies forced the Republic to desperate measures. Commanders began preparing Bessie and the rest of the International Brigade to cross the Ebro River, whose journey promised difficulty enough, but whose destination promised both sure hostility from the Nationalist troops housed there and the foreboding certainty that survival depended solely on capturing enemy supplies (after crossing the Ebro, Bessie wrote in his diary of the lack of food and his and his comrades&rsquo; sleeping &ldquo;in straw, in stone barn[s]; dead tired, hungry, wet with perspiration&rdquo;). This, coupled with the vastly superior arms and numbers of the Nationalist force, made for a grim outlook for Bessie and the rest of the 80,000 troops carrying out the offensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unexpectedly, the slightly inexperienced Nationalist troops on the other side were taken by surprise and shock when the Republic&rsquo;s troops first made their move. But soon after the initial Republican victory, the Nationalists struck back so furiously that Bessie wrote of a full week without taking off his boots, even when resting. The back and forth dragged on and continued through the sweltering summer heat of August, which Bessie described as having drenched the men &ldquo;from head to foot with sweat.&rdquo; The rocky terrain did them no favors either, making digging trenches (and much-needed graves) an impossible endeavor. Food was both scarce and bad (Bessie particularly recalled &ldquo;a petrified sort of blood-sausage that was more gristle than meat&rdquo;), and diarrhea was rampant in the camp. But through it all, Bessie found both time and energy to put into writing his thoughts and experiences, writing one afternoon as he sat awaiting the call to action, &ldquo;At such times the tension is intolerable&hellip; Your stomach clenches and unclenches&hellip; and there is a deep ache in your chest. You look around and you see other men sitting, talking calmly, showing no fear in their faces, acting as though they were on a picnic in the woods&hellip; For men do not like to show fear in the presence of other men, and they put on a good act.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bessie noted that he would act just as coolly as the other men, but knew inside as he watched more and more drafted, spiritless, and unfit Spanish reinforcements arrive that the Republic was becoming increasingly more desperate in its likewise increasingly futile efforts. The Americans remained steadfastly loyal to their cause, but Spanish men began deserting. Even when the Republican side received a rare piece of good news in the form of new anti-aircraft guns, they did almost nothing against the vastly superior Nationalist aircraft, a fact which Bessie described as &ldquo;heart-breaking&rdquo; and only added to his waning confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rare breaks in the constant fighting brought even worse horrors than the chaos it replaced; Bessie recalled trying to &ldquo;[rise] from the narrow niche in which you had been lying in all day[;] it was almost impossible&hellip; you had to look at [your legs] to assure yourself that they were still there, and will them to move.&rdquo; The misfortunes piled on: Bessie&rsquo;s best friend was shot in the eye and shortly thereafter died, a Nationalist shell finding its mark that was a Republican food truck resulted in no food for the night, and, perhaps worst of all, word reached the men of France and Britain&rsquo;s eagerness to placate the increasingly hostile Hitler, which meant that any previous shred of hope for aid from the Western democracies had now all but disappeared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also taking notice of these happenings was Stalin, who was growing continuously convinced that Hitler would be quite a formidable enemy, and one that would need to be faced without the help of France and Britain. Stalin began diverting attention away from Spain, withdrawing Soviet officers and ceasing the shipment of arms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spain&rsquo;s government took note of this and, clinging onto desperate hopes of pressuring Franco into similarly withdrawing his foreign troops, declared in front of the League of Nations that all International Brigaders would be withdrawn from and pushed out of Spain. Bessie knew the Spanish government&rsquo;s gamble was one of low stakes, for of the mere few thousand worn-out Brigaders left, most lay in hospital beds rather than on the frontlines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so, Bessie and the rest of the Americans&rsquo; time in Spain ended in October of 1938, with their efforts culminating in a celebratory march down one of Barcelona&rsquo;s most splendid streets for an official farewell. In their mismatched footwear and run-down attire, the men cried and marched to the tune of raucous cheering from Spanish civilians mingled with the sounds of the Republican planes flying overhead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though his time in Spain had come to an end, Bessie&rsquo;s impact was far from over. Upon his return to the States, his Spanish Civil War journals became the basis of his famous wartime memoir, Men in Battle (1939), which Ernest Hemingway would commend as a &ldquo;true, honest, [and] fine book. Bessie writes truly and finely of all that he could see&hellip; and he saw enough.&rdquo; Bessie would go on to become a celebrated novelist and screenwriter, the latter of which would lead him to a prominent role in the 1940s as one of the blacklisted Hollywood Ten that resisted anti-communist investigations into the film industry by the House of Representatives. Even when not fighting for Spain in uniform, Bessie remained unwaveringly loyal to his Communist and anti-fascist beliefs, continuing the greater fight and purpose of the Spanish Civil War.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Fanny Golub was born on April 18th, 1904 into a Jewish family. Not much is known about her childhood, except that she had a strong passion for helping others. Therefore, it was no surprise when she pursued medicine and graduated in 1926 as &ldquo;Fannie&rdquo; Golub, from the Hunter-Bellevue School of Nursing on East 26th Street in Kips Bay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause she was so dedicated to her work, she went as far as to find a home across the street from Bellevue Hospital. She resided at 142 East 27th Street in Kips Bay throughout the following decade in order to keep her commute short. Whilst she was working at the hospital through the Great Depression, Golub found people who shared her ideology at a local communist organization. Though she was never a certified member of the Communist party, she had strong ties with the Leftist movement and was able to form lifelong connections. Between attending party meetings and working as a nurse, she moved to 142 East 18th Street in Gramercy Park by 1937 which, although further from her workplace, was larger in size. Unfortunately, most records of her affiliation to the communist organization were lost during the McCarthy era.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1936, news was spreading of a Nationalist rebellion led by Spanish Generals. This rebellion rose to overthrow the established Popular Front Republic in Spain. President Roosevelt&rsquo;s administration was critical of any American involvement in this civil war. As the war progressed, Golub grew increasingly concerned that fascism was beginning to take hold as Adolf Hitler offered assistance to the Spanish coup d&rsquo;etat leaders. Golub decided something needed to be done to stop the advance of fascism around the world. On March 24th, 1937 she received passport #378165 and, only a month later, she departed for Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGolub served under Dr. Barksky&rsquo;s team on the battlefront alongside other U.S. nurses, including Salaria Kea, Helen Freeman, Grace Margolis etc. During her time in Spain, it became the norm to work under pressure and with limited resources, including a lack of sterile tools. Many tragedies unfolded around Golub, including bombings, and she grew accustomed to the war-torn environment. On the 15th of April 1938, she was working directly on the Aragon front and witnessed the death of many Abraham Lincoln Brigade volunteers while tending to the wounded. After this unfortunate event, her team retreated to living and working out of a Jesuit college until June of that year. During her stay, she sometimes had to share her clothing and a cot with her fellow volunteers. Despite the many hardships faced during this war, the nurses grew to be very close friends and recalled Golub fondly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGolub left Spain on August 13th, 1938. Unable to travel directly from Spain to the U.S. due to President Roosevelts&rsquo; restrictions, Golub crossed the border to France and spent three to five days in Paris before sailing on the RMS Aquitania to the U.S. Still, Golub&rsquo;s days of fighting fascism were not yet over. In further allegiance against fascism, she served again as a nurse during World War II. Despite many years of service, Golub was discriminated against, possibly due to her gender and religion. She had to file a discrimination complaint, and yet was still determined to continue her service towards helping others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe passed away in Kings County, Brooklyn and was buried by the Jewish Center of Hyde Park. Though she never married or had children in her lifetime, her headstone reads &ldquo;Freedom Fighter&rdquo; and &ldquo;Loving Daughter, Sister, and Aunt&rdquo;.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Born on October 23rd, 1904, Evan Biddle Shipman was the middle child of Ellen McGowan Biddle Shipman, a landscape architect, and Louis Evan Shipman, a successful playwright, editor, and essayist. Shipman grew up in the small, quiet town of Plainfield in Sullivan County, New Hampshire. Growing up in a rural atmosphere, Shipman was surrounded by vast swaths of land, teeming with animals, especially horses. This kindled his interest in horses, which his fans would, later on, consider &ldquo;The greatest writer of thoroughbred racing this continent has ever produced.&rdquo; He was born into a wealthy family as both of his parents were renowned professionals in their careers. This allowed him to pursue his early equestrian interests, which would develop into one of his greatest passions later on, along with writing prose.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter graduating from Oak Park-River Forest High School in June 1917, Shipman became a reporter months later. He also enrolled in Groton School, Massachusetts, and Sailsbury, Connecticut schools, but finished at neither. At Groton, he was noted as an &ldquo;omnivorous reader.&rdquo; However, the New England county fair horse racing scene was too tempting for Shipman and he headed for a new chapter of his life in Europe, where he graduated from the University of Louvain in Belgium and earned his Graduate Degree at The Sorbonne in France.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter university, Shipman went back to America, this time settling in 19 Beckman Place, New York City. However, Shipman headed back to Paris from New York in 1924 to reunite with his father. He had a strong relationship with his father, but a strained one with his mother, so it was important for him to stay connected with his father. His father, Louis, was in Paris with him and they often traveled together between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Shipman had a passion for writing, in part, this can be credited to his father, a renowned playwright.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWriting poems was always a passion for Shipman since it came to him naturally, so he always jumped at the opportunity of getting his work published. In Paris, he was on the hunt for an American named Gotham Munson. Munson was an editor for a small magazine and Shipman hoped he could share his poetry with Munson. However, when he arrived at Munson&rsquo;s address, he was greeted by Ernest Hemingway instead. Munson had moved back to America and Hemingway now lived on the second floor above the sawmill at 113 Rue Notre Dame des Champs (address from a letter to Hemingway from Shipman, 29 October 1949). The two hit off instantaneously and their personalities automatically clicked. They then proceeded to spend hours talking openly. This accidental encounter paved the way for a formative friendship with one of the greatest American novelists of all time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHemingway then introduced Shipman to Gertrude Stein, who introduced him to Andre Masson, a penniless young painter with promise. Hemingway, Shipman, and Masson became close friends and formed a close circle of expatriate Americans in Paris during the 1920s. Stein called them &ldquo;a lost generation.&rdquo; In Paris, Shipman was allowed free thought and liberal actions, where in America he could not. Often, in salons where art and literature were spread, alcohol was on the menu. It stimulated creativity and communication among many artists, similar to the Demimondes in Montmartre, France in the mid-19 century. This led to Shipman&rsquo;s heavy drinking habits, often accompanied by fellow friends, usually Hemingway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring this time, Shipman was also dedicated to his writing, publishing poetry in a variety of magazines, including Transition, Scribner&rsquo;s, The Republic and the Nation, and later in The New Yorker and Esquire. His prose mainly reflected his passion for horse racing and in 1935, Scribner published his novel Free For All, which was about the horse harness sport. His first novel was praised by critics but unfortunately sold poorly. Shipman was an expert on harness breeding and frequently drove horses in workouts. His daily schedule usually included attending a thoroughbred track in the afternoon and a trotting track at night.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen Shipman returned to the states, he married Elizabeth Gerwig of Pittsburgh. However, the marriage did not last long as the couple drank heavily. The final straw was Elizabeth&rsquo;s emotional issues, which led to her confinement in a mental hospital. Shipman wrote a poem &ldquo;Mazeppa,&rdquo; most likely attributed to Gerwig, where he illustrates women as flowers, whose sweet voices turn to the harsh and shrill complaining of strumpets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo escape his marital problems, Shipman returned to Paris in 1937 at Hemingway&rsquo;s request. Shipman volunteered to help Hemingway by delivering three ambulances through France into Spain for the Republican Forces fighting Franco. After successfully delivering the ambulances, Shipman returned to France, where he agreed to lead American volunteers for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade back to Spain. Convinced by Hemingway and in a time of conflict after his failed marriage, Shipman agreed to contribute to something bigger than himself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrough a period of heavy restriction on entry into Spain, Shipman had to lead his men through the precipitous Pyrenees Mountains, where many met their downfall. In an attempt to cross the dangerous, rocky terrain of the mountains at night, the group led by Shipman was discovered and arrested by French border guards. They were immediately jailed for six weeks at Toulouse. However, this didn&rsquo;t stop Shipman and he quickly returned to Spain after his stint in jail.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn May 1937, Shipman arrived in Spain to fight with the Loyalists side in the Spanish Civil War and served in XV Brigade, Washington Battalion, and Lincoln-Washington Battalion until July 18th, 1937. Shipman enlisted as an infantryman and showed immense courage on the battlefield. He still kept in touch with his good friend Hemingway, who described him as &ldquo;pale, ragged, limping and profoundly cheerful,&rdquo; even after several months of battling. Shipman often visited Hemingway during his free time, visiting him at his home in Cuba.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShipman fought courageously during the Battle of Jarama and Battle of Brunete. However, on July 17th, 1937, while fighting at the Brunete, Shipman was hit in both thighs by machine-gun bullets from a strafing plane. Despite the injuries, Shipman claims he never felt a thing during the incident since he was unconscious. However, due to Shipman&rsquo;s injuries from the aerial bombardment, he was sent to recover in Madrid, where he spent 4-5 days convalescing, but then transferred to Murcia in August 1937, where he stayed until January 15th, 1938. The injury would stay with Shipman forever as he carried shrapnel fragments in his leg for the rest of his life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter sustaining this injury, Shipman couldn&rsquo;t return to the battlefield immediately, so he contributed in other ways. He worked as an interpreter for the Quartermasters and as a Hospital Commissar and in mid-January. He was also sent to Madrid, where he wrote video scripts for the Voice of Spain. In Spring 1938, he was sent to Barcelona as editor of the Volunteer of Liberty, and later in May, Shipman was discharged and repatriated back to America. The journey back was difficult as Shipman was arrested once again by the French Guarde Mobile for an illegal border crossing into France. Due to Shipman&rsquo;s likable nature, the French officers bought Shipman cognac and tobacco out of their own money and didn&rsquo;t handcuff him as usual. Eventually, Shipman avoided the charges by leaving France for America.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter participating in the Spanish Civil War and contributing greatly to the Republican side, Shipman returned to America on June 21st, 1938, where he immediately hustled his way back to writing. He became a columnist for New York&rsquo;s Morning Telegraph, a renowned newspaper covering professional sports. However, Shipman&rsquo;s calling sent him on a different path, when he then enlisted in World War II, where he was a correspondent. He was also sergeant major of the Sixteenth Armored Division&rsquo;s Sixteenth Regiment and was with the 787th Tank Battalion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter World War II, Shipman became more invested in his writing and was highly regarded as a horse-racing columnist and writer. Due to his keen observation and technical knowledge of horseracing, he was extremely important in the horseracing industry. He was later made a featured columnist of the Morning Telegraph, free to write whatever he wanted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy the time Shipman was 50, he was considered &ldquo;a fine ruin of a man,&rdquo; but this didn&rsquo;t prevent him from continuing his passion in the horse racing tracks. To this day, there is a horse race named after Shipman called the Evan Shipman Handicap (NYB).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShipman&rsquo;s health eventually deteriorated and he died of cancer in 1957 in New York Hospital. He was then buried in his family cemetery in Plainfield, New Hampshire. Though Shipman died at 53, the impact the Spanish Civil War had on him was life-changing and one that he never forgot. Writing to his friend Hemingway, who he managed to stay tight with even through a long-distance relationship, he described himself as &ldquo;in a bad state in many ways, both discouraged and confounded,&rdquo; before the war but by the time he journeyed home, though, he was a different man. &ldquo;After such a long time, I feel a real eagerness for work. Again I have confidence in myself.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

At this time, according to Lopoff&rsquo;s passport that he received on August 3rd, 1937 his address was listed as 219 East 12th Street, NYC (Spring Valley, New York). He ultimately arrived in Spain on August 22, 1937.Aaron Lopoff served with the XV BDE, Lincoln-Washington BN, Co.2 as Lieutenant, company commander and adjutant. Lopoff was a respected man, his anti-fascist understanding along with his desire to lead his company better made the Command of the Lincoln to consider Aaron Lopoff as one of its most experienced and responsible leaders. As Lopoff used to say: &ldquo;When you have a lot of other guys to worry about, you can&rsquo;t be afraid for yourself&rdquo; Lopoff was the type of leader that wanted to spare as much of his comrades as he possibly can. These characteristics made the people around Lopoff respect him as they can feel the sense of responsibility that this man has. On the night of August 17th, 1938 during the Ebro Offensive on Hill 666, Lopoff was wounded in action- receiving 3 m.g bullets to the head, and destroyed one eye which may have resulted in the loss of the other. Aaron Lopoff later died in the hospital due to his wounds. Lopoff was single prior to his death, there were no records of him being married and he does not have any known offspring. Aaron Lopoff was a brother figure to Alvah Bessie, another famous veteran that served in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Lopoff served as Bessie&rsquo;s company commander and most of what we&rsquo;ve learned of Lopoff comes from Bessie&#39;s notebook that later on was published.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Michael &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; Patrick McLaughlin was an Irish-Canadian-American who fought alongside the Republic against Franco&rsquo;s fascist forces during the Spanish Civil War in the Abraham Lincoln Battalion and Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, which were in the Fifteenth (XV) International Brigade. McLaughlin was born to a devout Catholic Irish family on September 24, 1890, in Ballyhaunis, County Mayo, Ireland. The repercussions of the Irish Famine were still drastic, and Ballyhaunis was still held back in an agrarian, rural society, which resulted in McLaughlin&rsquo;s life in poverty. He was the son of James McLaughlin and Mary Nolan. He had a large family, with four other siblings (Delia McDonough, Bernhard McLaughlin, James McLaughlin, and Jack McLaughlin), which was common in rural societies. The socioeconomic disparities in Great Britain, especially between the British and the Irish, would eventually spur him to be a passionate Marxist communist, thereby motivating him to fight for the Communist Republican forces on behalf of Canada and America in the Spanish Civil War a few decades later. Not much is recorded about his adolescence or time before his residency in Canada, but it is assumed that he helped his family through agriculture, which was very common in late 19th, early 20th century Ireland. Due to the bucolic nature of Northern Ireland at that time, it is likely he did not get an education. The known schools in Ballyhaunis would be founded in the late 20th century.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As was common with many Irish people, he emigrated elsewhere in hopes of finding employment opportunities and a better standard of living. He moved to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and married Ellen Costello (1894-1974) in 1915. They had four children together: Margaret Stevens (1916-?), John Thomas McLaughlin (1917-2006), Eileen Jordon (1925-?), and John James McLaughlin (1927-?). He was a humble man, working as a coal miner in Canada, seeking political and social clubs to support his large family. Throughout his time in the Western Hemisphere leading up to his involvement in the Spanish Civil War, he would travel to and from Canada and the USA, developing his passion for communism and anti-fascism. Accordingly, he resided in New York City, New York, USA on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He would join the American Federation of Labor in 1918 and become the New York Secretary of the Communist Party of the USA in 1935. Conversely, he was a member of the Communist Party of Canada in 1935.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being spurred by his comrades in the Communist Parties, he became dedicated to the interests of the Popular Front-led Republic in Spain. Still living in poverty, he decided that his calling would be in Spain to resist the evils of fascism and potentially implement communist ideals in the shattered Republic. Along with many other volunteers in the XV International Brigade from NYC, he boarded the <em>Washington</em> on March 10, 1937. It is recorded that he arrived in Spain on April 8, 1937, likely at Albacete, due to the time of his journey and the fact that Albacete was the center for the International Brigades. He was assigned to the Abraham Lincoln Battalion on June 5, 1937, which was predominantly American-composed and named after famous American President Abraham Lincoln. McLaughlin, along with other Canadian immigrants and Canadian natives, named themselves the Mackenzie-Papineau Section, after the famed William Lyon Mackenzie and Louis-Joseph Papineau of Canada, who led the Rebellion of 1837-1838 in Canada.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He first saw action with his comrades during the Brunete Campaign in July 1937, which was a devastating failure for the International Brigades. He witnessed the deaths of many of his peers during that time, and he was badly wounded in his head and hip. After the unfortunate results of the Brunete Campaign, he pushed for the formation of a Canadian Battalion with some of his Canadian comrades, which led to the formal establishment of the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion in July 1937. After being transported to northern Spain, he witnessed his second major battle, the Aragon Offensive in March 1938. He was often characterized as being lighthearted, carefree, drunk, and physically weak by his colleagues, which contributed to his dwindling war performance. This became such an issue that during the Aragon offensive, he was arrested by Republican officials in April 1938 at Las Presas for drunkenness and jailed for 15 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Nationalist forces continuously pressed on the International Brigades, McLaughlin sought to exit the war out of exhaustion and misconduct. He traveled to the Pyrenees mountains and snuck through them to get into France to ultimately return to America. He rode by train all the way up to Le Havre, France, where he would return to New York City clandestinely aboard the <em>Britannic </em>by October 13, 1938.&nbsp;He would become officially naturalized as an American citizen on December 15, 1938. He would stay in the USA for the rest of his life, living a hidden and peaceful life in his humble apartment on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. He died on February 26th, 1974, and he was buried in the Calvary Cemetery of Queens, New York City.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>P.S</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with many volunteers in the Spanish Civil War, there was a lack of photographic records of them; the most that has been discovered at this time for the common soldier would be a group picture, like the one with the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion provided by ALBA&#39;s <em>The Volunteer</em>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://albavolunteer.org/2016/06/jarama-series-canadians-in-the-lincoln-battalion/\" target=\"_blank\">https://albavolunteer.org/2016/06/jarama-series-canadians-in-the-lincoln-battalion/</a>). Unfortunately, this truth holds evident with McLaughlin, whose precise identity has still not been found. From some of the provided portraits in the archives, a considerable amount of volunteers in the group photo could be eliminated as being McLaughlin. Additionally, from contemporaneous, written archives, one could deduce McLaughlin to be the man in the third row because of his short stature and considerably weak physique, as noted by his peers. As the world continues to draw note of the implications of the Spanish Civil War and give a deeper dive into its history and the valiant men and women who fought within it, hopefully, McLaughlin&#39;s identity could be definitively pinpointed. At this moment, though, this unknown person appears to be a plausible&nbsp;candidate for McLaughlin.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>John &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; Harley Yellin was born on August 15, 1913, in West Sussex, Connecticut, to father Sam Yellin and mother Mary Yellin. His father was a liberal and/or a socialist while his mother was a socialist. They owned a small business. He studied architecture for 6 years at Brooklyn Technical. He lived in New York for some time and worked at Jay&rsquo;s Auto Service (likely his father&rsquo;s business). He was not part of any trade union in America, but he was a scoutmaster in the Boy Scouts of America, and was in the branch committee of the International Workers Order.<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\nYellin became interested in the proletariat movement in 1911 after attending some lectures and conferences in 1933, and through the International Workers Order. In 1934, he joined the Communist Party, and was in Section Two of the Bensonhurst Cell.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe joined the Republican side of the Spanish Civil War, as part of International Brigades, with no prior military experience. He left for Spain in March 1937 and arrived in either late March or in early April 1937. Initially, he was part of the First Battalion of the 13th--Jaroslav Dombrowski Polish--International Brigade, where he worked in the Service Sanitaire from April 21, 1937 to July 5, 1937 at C&oacute;rdoba.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe was in Brunete from July 6, 1937, to August 10, 1937. On July 23, 1937, he was wounded in the face and arms by shrapnel while loading patients into his ambulance, and stayed at the hospital at Hoyo de Manzanares for 7 to 8 days.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe worked as a mechanic and an ambulance driver at an Auto Park in Albacete from August 15, 1937 to April 15, 1938, where he became responsible for the American group. He was sentenced to 10 days of confinement in December 1937 due to a fight, which he thought was done &ldquo;merely to discredit [him].&rdquo; He went to guerilla school in Barcelona from April 15, 1938 to July 38, 1938. He became the administrator and political commissar of the International Brigade in Horta from July 1938 to October 1938. In all, he held the roles of Sergeant, Chief of Transport Section, Chief of Material of Transport Battalion, and Political Commissar.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYellin requested repatriation in September 1937, and returned to the U.S. on December 20, 1938 aboard the Ausonia. He later participated in World War Two in the U.S. Navy as a radar mechanic from April 1944 to December 1945.<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\nYellin spoke English, Spanish, and a bit of French and German. He was described as a &ldquo;good anti-fascist&rdquo; and &ldquo;politically reliable.&rdquo; He became a member of the Communist Party of Spain in late 1937, and joined the Young Communist League. He married Anne Yellin, and died on April 27, 1972.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>William James &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; Bailey, most notably as, Bill Bailey, was born on January 23, 1910. He grew up in Hoboken, New Jersey and in Jersey City, in a family of 13 children. Unfortunately, seven children died before the age of one, with just six children, including him, to remain. They lived in poverty due to their Irish identity which made it really hard to be employed during the early 1900&rsquo;s America. His parents eventually split due to his father&rsquo;s alcohol addiction and inability to earn enough money to support the family. As Bailey recalled, his father never had a paternal love for his family. He was arrested for constantly picking fights drunk and physically abusing his mother. When they finally split, Bailey noted his father&rsquo;s sense of liberation from the burden of being a father, which was heartbreaking for Bailey to see that his father resented them so much. They never met again until many years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nTo make sure that the family had enough to live by, Bailey&rsquo;s mother would go out to New York City Wall Street every day in search of a job. She would usually work as a maid and scrubbed floors. His sister, Kate would work at a church for 15 cents an hour, and his brother, John would work at a bakery. They were both eventually fired from their jobs when Kate ran away stealing a ham and when John stole doughnuts from the bakery shop. Because his family lived in such poverty, his brother would steal bottles of milk from other people, leading to his arrest to jail and reform school. Bailey went to Catholic school in St. Peters Church and had an education until he was in the fifth grade when his mother pulled him out of school in order to get a job and to start working. He later started to work for an Irishman that was living upstairs from him at the waterfront. He would work for six days a week for $21.52. After that, his family decided to move to New York near Hell&#39;s Kitchen, on West 38th Street between 9th and 10th Avenues for work. He eventually started sailing in 1929-1930 on a ferry boat at Pier 1 and earned $47 a month, which was considered a fortune at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHowever, he suffered from miserable working conditions, prompting him to join the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1929 and later, Marine Workers&rsquo; Industrial Union (MWIU) in 1930 to help fight for the rights and welfare of seamen. At first, he was hesitant about joining the Union, mainly because there was a fee that he had to pay every month for membership and he was at the time not able to afford it. However, once he joined, he was very invested and passionate about the causes they were fighting for. He became the union organizer. He eventually developed an interest in reading about the Soviet Union as he worked with members of a group of communists called the POC and later decided to become a member of the Communist Party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHis loyalty and enthusiasm as a communist member naturally caused him to be an anti-fascist along with the other members of his party. When word came out that an American seaman, Lawrence Simpson was arrested in Germany for bringing in anti-fascist literature, Bailey along with the other communist seamen decided to gather at the dock of a German ship, S.S. Bremen in New York, which was ready to sail from Pier 46 on 46th Street on July 26th, 1935. This act against fascism attracted the attention of thousands of people as they watched Bailey and a few other men cut the Bremen&rsquo;s swastika down and into the Hudson River. They were arrested but released and dismissed of any charges due to their courageous act against Nazism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNews about the war in Spain was spreading like wild-fire in New York where Bailey resided. He was very invested in the idea that action was finally being taken against fascism and sprang for the opportunity to volunteer in the war because he believed that if fascism can be defeated in the Spanish Civil War, then it can be defeated anywhere. He joined the Abraham Lincoln Battalion seamen&rsquo;s machine gun company sailing from his home address 191 (198) 11th Avenue, NYC (as stated in his passport) on June 16th, 1937 on the ship Aquitania, and arrived in Spain on June 31st, 1937. He rose to rank as the Company Commissar and was recognized for his bravery and strong will when fighting at Belchite and even managing to obtain a fascist banner which he sent back to the United States. On July 14th, 1937, the Lincoln Battalion merged with the George Washington Battalion after heavy losses from both sides. At the end of the Spanish Civil War, he returned on to the US on December 20, 1938, aboard the Ausonia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBailey&rsquo;s contributions to the fight against fascism do not end after the Spanish Civil War. He later served as a business agent for the Marine Firemen, Oilers, and Watertenders Union (MFOW), before joining and shipping himself out to the invasion of the Philippines as a mariner under MFOW working aboard the U.S flag vessels to prevent the risk of sending more and more men out to their deaths. Later in the Korean War (1950-1953), he was blacklisted from working in the Merchant Marine due to his membership in the Communist Party. In 1953 he began to work as a longshoreman and continued to do so until he retired in 1975.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBailey, recognized by his many contributions to the war effort continued to have a lasting impact to this day. He was in numerous documentaries including, Seeing Red (1983) and The Good Fight (1984). He also has his own autobiography dedicated to his son called, The Kid from Hoboken. Bill Bailey died on February 27, 1995, with his ashes spread across the sea. From working hard at the sea ever since he was little, joining unions and the Communist Party to help fight for his rights, to joining the Abraham Lincoln Brigades to help fight against fascism, Bill Bailey was definitely an honorable and strong fighter in support of his beliefs and passions until the very end.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Leslie Kish (originally L&aacute;szl&oacute; Kiss) was born on July 27, 1910, in Popra-Felka, Slovakia which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He is of Hungarian descent. In 1925, his family chose to immigrate to the US in a wave of Hungarian immigration. As the great Hungarian poet Attila Jozsef put it: &ldquo;one and a half million of our people staggered out to America.&rdquo; His father died soon after their arrival forcing Leslie, then 16, to work during the day and attend Bay Ridge Evening School at night to support his mother and 3 siblings. They settled at 335 East 79th Street, NY and his mother opened up a pastry shop in Manhattan. Kish went on to study at the City College of New York Evening School while working as a lab assistant at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. In 1937, he became a US citizen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy 1937, he only had a year left to complete his degree but instead chose to suspend his education and fight fascism in Spain. On March 14, he arrived in Spain as a volunteer for the Loyalists. There, he was initially assigned to a medical unit. Eventually, however, he met a Hungarian man at a bar who told him, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to go through basic training,&#39;&rdquo; he recalled. &ldquo;&lsquo;You go right to the front, we train you with the rifles, and you start shooting. And also, we have the best cooks.&#39;&rdquo; And so, Kish made his way to the front of the Hungarian Battalion and was injured in the Battle of Huesca in June of 1937. Afterward, he spent three weeks at the Benicasim Hospital and eventually joined the John Brown Battery which was positioned on the Estremadura Front from October through December 1937. They eventually relocated to the Toledo Front, where they remained until the Internationals were repatriated. By the end of the war, he was ranked Teniente (Lieutenant). He returned to NYC on February 4, 1939, aboard the SS President Harding. Kish resumed going to night school at City College and completed his BS in Mathematics cum laude.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1940, he moved to Washington DC and was hired by the US Census Bureau. A year later, he moved to the Division of Program Surveys of the Department of Agriculture and joined a group of social scientists that created a survey research unit. During World War II, he once again chose service to justice over his career, working as a meteorologist of the US Air Army Corps. In 1947, his research group went on to work at the University of Michigan and founded the Institute for Social Research, the world&rsquo;s largest academic survey and research organization. There he developed the Kish grid, a statistical randomized surveying method as well as sampling techniques that were used in the 1948 election to predict the victory of Harry Truman. There, he received his MA in mathematics and Ph.D. sociology, while also working full-time as a lecturer and researcher. Kish became Professor Emeritus of Sociology in 1981 and founded the Sampling Program for Foreign Statisticians which trains statisticians from developing countries. He passed away on October 7, 2000 at the age of 90. Since his death, the Institute of Social Research established the Leslie Kish International Fellowship which funds foreign students studying survey sampling.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>In 1915, Moses (Moe) Fishman was born in New York City. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School and enrolled at City College. Due to the financial burden of attending university, Fishman never completed his degree. Before volunteering to join the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, Moe Fishman was part of a number of anti-fascist groups. Fishman&rsquo;s anti-fascist sentiment grew as he researched Hitler and Mussolini. This led him to join the Young Men&#39;s&#39; Hebrew Association. There, he actively participated in the campaign against the United States&rsquo; participation in the 1936 Olympics because it was being held in Germany. As an anti-fascist, he refused to support this, so he later joined the Young Communist League at the 92nd St YMCA. At the time, they were the most active group against the Olympics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt just 21-years-old, Moe Fishman decided to volunteer to fight in Spain in April of 1937. His parents were not supportive of his choice. Moe Fishman had no prior experience in fighting, so it was understandable that his parents did not want him to do this. When Fishman volunteered, he was just working as a truck driver. When he was later accepted to be a part of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade as a truck driver, he called his parents after he made the decision to go. At that point, it was too late for Fishman to go back on his decision. He was committed to going despite his parents&#39; wishes. The&nbsp;only thing that Fishman brought with him to Spain was his toothbrush.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, Fishman did not go directly to Spain. He and others first went to France. There were 40 or 50 other men with him on this journey. While in France, Fishman and a group of 6 other men were hiding with farmers. They used buckets as toilets and were only allowed to go outside at nighttime. These were some of the precautions that they took because they did not want to be caught by other people. When it was safe to leave France, Fishman and the other men who were hiding got on a bus to the Pyrenees mountains. Fishman and the other volunteers would have to cross this mountain on foot to reach Spain.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs they were climbing over the mountains, they were warned about straying from the group. If someone got lost, they were instructed to stay put and wait for someone to come looking for them. In an interview, Fishman recalled that he had heard of people who got lost whose bodies were never found. Eventually, Fishman safely reached Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He recalled that the Republic had bought weapons from Mexico and Czechoslovakia. They also obtained weapons from the Soviet Union. He said that although the weapons were backward compared to that of Hitler&rsquo;s army, they were doable. However, the Republic was outnumbered in terms of weapons and ammunition. In 1937, they were outnumbered by 7 to 1. By the end of the war, they were outnumbered by 11 to 1. Despite the disadvantages that the Republic had, Fishman was eager to fight the Fascists.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis first battle in Spain was the Brunete Offensive. Unfortunately, he was shot in the thigh and severely wounded. He said that if the Republic had not won that battle, it is likely that he would not be alive at the time of the interview. He had to lay on the ground, unable to move the whole day until people could safely transport him to Hospital 16. There, they temporarily set his knee with pins. Fishman was in and out of hospitals the whole time that he was in Spain. He was hopeful that he would be able to recover to see more fighting in Spain but never did. He did, however, recover enough to fight as a merchant marine in World War II.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFishman never regretted fighting in Spain because he was so strongly anti-fascist. In fact, he went on to be a board member of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade organization (VALB). It was the first of its kind as it offered rehabilitation services, such as access to jobs and medical treatment. When the organization was first formed, they faced strong opposition from the government. They labeled it as a communist organization and even passed the subversive activist control act, which specifically targeted members of the VALB. The act demanded that all communists register as so. Failure to comply resulted in a fine of $1000 each day that they did not register as a communist and a year&#39;s worth of time served in jail. However, Moe Fishman and the rest of the board fought this in court and won.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrough it all, Moe Fishman had an unwavering commitment to defeating fascism. In addition to helping the veterans, Fishman also worked closely with the Joint Anti-Fascist Committee to help Spaniards settle into new and better lives. They helped Spaniards go to places in Latin America where they could safely reside and sent them resources like food, money, and clothes. They also sent care packages to jails where Spanish refugees were being held. Fishman worked tirelessly to fight fascism and helped rehabilitate those affected by it.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Thomas Page was born on September 29th, 1909. He only attended 2 years of high school, and as a young African American in New York City, he experienced a lot of difficulty finding jobs. When the Great Depression hit, this struggle became worse, and he resorted to making and selling illegal alcohol. During the Great Depression, the Communist Party worked to organize Unemployed Councils from the third of the population that was jobless. Page joined the Unemployed Councils, protesting for jobless support and more opportunities for workers. As he saw it, &ldquo;it was the Communist Party who did everything, everyone else just talked&rdquo;. Thus, following many involved in the Unemployed Councils, Page joined the Communist Party.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPage seemed to have planned for his involvement in Spain long in advance, obtaining a passport in 1934. At the time, he was living at 14 Randall Court Rockville Center in Long Island, just outside of Queens. He enlisted on February 18th, 1934, and finally went to Spain on March 10th, 1937 aboard the Washington. Once in Spain, he was assigned to drive a truck towards the Cordoba Front. After this mission, he was assigned to the machine gun company in the 20th International Battalion. Afterwards, he joined the International Brigade Auto Park, again as a driver. Due to the high numbers of casualties in the Battle of Brunete, the Washington Battalion and Abraham Lincoln Battalion were merged, forming the Lincoln-Washington (or simply Lincoln) Battalion. This was the Anglo-American battalion Page joined. He became a squad leader within the Battalion, helping to train new Spanish conscripts, as the international battalions became mixed with Spanish soldiers. In the Ebro campaign, he was cited twice for bravery, sustaining two wounds to his shoulder and stomach and remaining in a hospital for much of the rest of his time in Spain. On December 10th, 1938 he took a Cunard Line ship, the RMS Ausonia, back to New York City. Though his time there was under a year, he experienced both the hardship and triumph that was the international battalions in Spain, later recounting in an interview, &ldquo;You give it everything you possibly can. You go out there with no shoes on, you go out there unabrigados(1), you go out there without an overcoat. You wanna win. You don&rsquo;t get cold, you don&rsquo;t get hot, you stick, you stay, you wanna win. That&rsquo;s what it means. I&rsquo;ve been so cold my hands are like, I couldn&rsquo;t open them up, but I didn&rsquo;t mind the cold. You wanna win. Other people, they wanna win. Slept under a little bit of straw, no blanket over you, but you gotta win. Wear a pair of overalls...and it&rsquo;s cold in Spain, it&rsquo;s very cold in Spain, but you wanna win: you&rsquo;re staying.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBack in New York City, he continued to be a stable member of the Communist Party, working as a guard for the Soviet Pavilion at the 1939 World&rsquo;s Fair. He also took up work as a guard for the New York fur market, likely using his experience fighting in the Spanish Civil War as credentials. When World War II broke out, he jumped at the chance to again fight Fascism, joining the U.S. Army. He likely felt the stark difference in experience between this and the Spanish Civil War, as he was again in a segregated environment. He was assigned to Company C, 376th Engineering Brigade, and served in North Africa, France, and Italy. After the war, he took up camera work, working both to repair cameras and as a photographer. During the second red scare and McCarthyism, he was of course questioned and followed by the FBI, but his stubbornness led them to move on. He died in April, 1985.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(1) The phrase is unclear in the interview, but it seems like he is using a Spanglish phrase coming from the word &lsquo;abrigados&rsquo;, which can mean people wearing jackets. Thus &lsquo;unabrigados&rsquo; means jacket-less people, which he translates in the next clause: without an overcoat.</p>\r\n",
