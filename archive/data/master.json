        "data": "<p>Rubin (&ldquo;Ruby&rdquo;) Kaufman was born on February 15, 1917. He lived at 318 Kesciosko Street, Brooklyn, New York in his youth and was a furrier by trade. Kaufman was registered for both the Communist Party and the Young Communist League, the Communist Party&rsquo;s officially recognized youth wing. The YCL was particularly prominent in the borough Kaufman lived in, Brooklyn, which was its founding location. Kaufman was a trade unionist, partaking in many &ldquo;pretty tough&rdquo; workers&rsquo; strikes, and was also Jewish. The intersectionality of the Jewish goal to weaken fascism and the ideological goal to protect fellow communists and other radicals likely made the choice to come to Spain somewhat easier for the nineteen-year-old.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKaufman sailed aboard the Normandie on December 26, 1936, to Le Havre, France, in the first group of American volunteers. The volunteers on this initial trip, hailing from locations all across the United States, went to Spain to fight in the Spanish foreign legion. As one of the 80 confirmed volunteers on board the Normandie, Kaufman met relative friendliness from most he came across on the journey. Upon arrival in France he was greeted by custom inspectors with cheers of &ldquo;Vive l&rsquo;Espagna!&rdquo;(Long live Spain). After various detours and connections, Kaufman&rsquo;s battalion eventually reached Albacete. In Albacete, Kaufman and the other men received their guns. There were not many guns and the guns that were there were almost all faulty in some major way; Kaufman&rsquo;s gun was especially bad, oftentimes being unable to fire.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing their initial reception, he and the brigade trained in a nearby training base in the small and traditional town of Villanueva de la Jara. The battalion he trained under was formally known as the 15th international brigade but quickly adopted the informal title of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. It was here in training that their lack of weaponry became apparent - only about 1 in 8 men had a gun and the other equipment they received(belts, etc.) was also mostly in a bad state. In spite of these challenges, Kaufman would soon enter the battle of Jarama with the rest of the brigade. He, some French soldiers, and another soldier from the Brigade who would become a friend, Joseph(Joe) Dallet, were eventually separated from the brigade to defend a position. Unlike most of Kaufman&rsquo;s battles, the men were not in trenches and had only stone parapets surrounding them and two machine guns as their weaponry. On the 23rd of February, Kaufman was hit by a grenade and shot through the leg almost simultaneously by advancing Nationalist soldiers. During the night, Dallet carried Kaufman on his back to a hospital in Murcia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKaufman would stay at the hospital for about two months, getting released in late march or early april. Here he met a prominent figure that he would continue to know throughout the war, Robert Hale Merriman, who was also at the hospital. After leaving the hospital, Kaufman would go on to remark about his experience at Jarama as being the price he had to pay to learn how to fight.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAround this time, he met William Herrick and they became acquaintances. Herrick would later write that Kaufman informed on him to the communist party because Kaufman found out Herrick received letters from a lovestonite friend. Herrick was very annoyed and wrote that he told Kaufman directly he was a &ldquo;prick&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing his recovery, Kaufman went to Tarazona where he trained the seaman section(the machine gun company) of the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion. Here, Kaufman would once again meet Merriman - Kaufman would later remark that he and Merriman were the only vets in the Mac-Paps. In his diary, Merriman recognized Kaufman as a problem because of his tendency to dominate exercises. Dallet would also arrive in the training camp, though he departed back to the Lincolns at once, deciding he didn&rsquo;t need any training. Soon later, Kaufman went with Merriman to the site of the battle of Brunete to observe. They were almost killed by the bombings and the great fires that pervaded the warzone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKaufman re-entered the front lines in the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion. Kaufman was one of the few people with battle experience in the battalion, resulting in him gaining the adjutant commander position. On July 16, Kaufman shot himself in the foot while cleaning his gun. He was sent to the Socorro Rojo Internacional Number 1 hospital and was able to make a very quick recovery and return to the battalion for their battle at Fuentes de Ebro(The Zaragoza Offensive). While he stayed at the hospital, Merriman came over to see how he was faring.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the Zaragoza offensive, the battalion attempted to retake many nationalist-held towns including Fuentes de Ebro, but the inexperience of the Mac-Paps proved disastrous. Kaufman described many of the recruits as very good and very brave men who truly believed in the cause but had no battle experience. By the end, Kaufman was wounded and Joe Dallet was killed. Propaganda spread that the battle was lost due to a traitorous tank commander that was supposedly the brother-in-law of Tukhachevsky(a Soviet General killed by Stalin in a show trial), but Kaufman did not buy into this. Merriman would also point out around this time Kaufman&rsquo;s mistake of leaving a flank open while retreating, leaving other groups in a bad position. Despite all that went wrong in the battle, Kaufman remarked that the Mackenzie-Papineau battalion did pretty well for a battalion of recruits(a statement which Merriman later affirmed).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn October 27th, Kaufman and the Mac-Paps were withdrawn from the front lines to Quinto. Here, Kaufman participated in some political meetings though he did it grudgingly and was never very interested in them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSumming up his experience in Spain, Kaufman was somewhat disappointed that his two main battles (Ebro and Jarama) were &ldquo;fouled up&rdquo;. Kaufman returned to the US on February 16, 1938, aboard the Lafayette. Returning to NYC, he married his wife, Lottie T. Evendorf(born 1915) on September 23, 1938. Around this time, Kaufman joined the VALB (Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade). The VALB mainly held fundraisers to support veterans of the Spanish Civil War, Spain, and other causes they considered worthy. His participation in the VALB would put him on the radar of various government agencies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKaufman later enlisted in the US army during WWII on March 30, 1943, but was medically discharged on February 16, 1944, due to Bronchial Asthma. While it&rsquo;s unclear if Kaufman actually had Bronchial Asthma, it was very common for Spanish Civil War veterans to be sidelined in WWII. Since it is fairly certain that the US government knew of Kaufman&rsquo;s participation in the Spanish Civil War, it&#39;s very possible that their reason for dismissing Kaufman was not legitimate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKaufman died in a car accident on February 4, 1972, in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Hyman Jacob Katz was born 01/03/1914 in New York City. His father was Elimelech Katz, an Austrian immigrant born 1890. His mother was Leah Katz(Feller), a Polish immigrant that immigrated to New York circa 1902-1908. Both parents were Jewish and worked as insurance agents.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKatz&rsquo; residence was 1550 55th Street, Brooklyn, New York, in Borough Park, a predominantly Jewish neighborhood. His family was deeply religious, and he attended a Yeshiva in Boro Park. He would later say that this Jewish education would color his experiences and activities for the rest of his life. He joined the Communist Party in 1934, becoming a financial secretary, and worked as a rabbi and teacher.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKatz was particularly concerned with anti-semitic and fascist movements growing abroad and home, which was his primary motive for joining the International Brigades, as explained in a letter to his mother. He explained that fascism would spread across the world if left unchecked, and as a Jewish communist, he would be their first target, saying &ldquo;If I permitted such a time to come as a Jew and a progressive, I would be among the first to fall under the axe of the fascists; all I could do then would be to curse myself and say, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I wake up when the alarm clock rang?&rdquo; The anti-fascist struggle resonated with him, as he saw the threat of fascism looming over his parents&rsquo; home countries of Austria and Poland. His family was deeply involved in leftist activism, as his uncles Joseph and Michael Feller were involved with the Young Communists League and Communist Party, although it is not confirmed that Katz himself joined the YCL.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKatz set sail for Spain aboard the RMS Queen Mary on July 7th, arriving in Setcases on the 18th. He served with the Lincoln battalion, a unit that had been battered and destroyed several times over during the fighting in Jarama and Brunette. He participated in the defense of Aragon around Belchite in the fall of 1937, being wounded on October 13. His letter to his mother was written during his hospital stay in Albacete in November. By January, he had recovered and joined the fighting at Teruel, where his company was cited for a special mention. His unit remained on the Teruel front throughout February. He was killed in action on March 3rd, 1938, in the 2nd Battle of Belchite, just prior to the mass retreat of Republican forces from Aragon.</p>\r\n",

There is little information about his early life other than that his family was Jewish and that he was a Communist. Spanish records say he lived in Chicago. He worked as a sailor, but it is unclear whether he served in the navy or simply sailed commercial vessels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Epstein arrived in Spain on March 1st, 1937, aboard the Washington. His journey was easier than that of most recruits, as the Canadian Parliament only passed the Canadian Foreign Enlistment Act (which prohibited volunteering in foreign wars) in April of 1937. It was formally applied to Spain in July of 1937. However, recruits were heavily screened by the Communist Party to eliminate the &quot;adventurous&quot; types. Most of those recruited had to have a history of working for the left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spanish records say that Epstein served in transport service in the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, which fought as part of the XV International Brigade. However, Epstein would have had to arrive with either the Lincoln or Washington Battalions, as Mackenzie-Papimeau was not formed until May of 1937. The Transport Service unit consisted of 280 men, including drivers, dispatchers, and mechanics. Records suggest he was involved in artillery transport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are discrepancies regarding the date and location of Epstein&#39;s death. Spanish records say he could have died on either the 10th of March, 1938 in Belchite, or on the 17th of March in Caspe. Canadian records say he was killed in Caspe on the 17th of March, 1938. It is possible that in the chaos of Belchite, Epstein became separated from his unit and they assumed he had died, leading to the discrepancy in records.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>The Jewish contribution to the International Brigade during the Spanish Civil War was often marginalized in the aftermath of the conflict. However, the Jewish people were among the first to volunteer to contain the spread of fascism. Thousands of Jews from 53 different nations, nearly 1,250 of them from the United States, risked their lives to travel to Spain to fight for the Republic. These Jewish volunteers originated from socialist and communist organizations, comprised nearly 10 percent of the volunteers, and were inspired by a &ldquo;strong sense of Jewish social justice.&rdquo; One such volunteer was Bernard Gerber, who offered his services to the Republican cause as an ambulance driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bernard Gerber was born on July 11, 1911, in Brooklyn, New York to working-class parents. He attended high school as teen, before entering the industrial workforce after graduation. Specifically, Gerber worked as a printer and later in a shoe factory located on 32-420th Street in midtown Manhattan. After entering the workforce, he joined the Workers Local of the United Shoe trade union. As an adult, Gerber became heavily involved in the labor struggle, and joined the Young Communist League in 1928, and the Communist Party of America in 1932. While in the league, Gerber received political training at the District and Section School of the YCL. He served as a daily worker agent within the party but held no official leadership position. Indoctrinated in the struggles of the communist party, Gerber led a strike against his shoe factory, leading to his arrest and imprisonment between 1934 and 1935.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the Spanish Civil War erupted, Gerber was determined to travel to Spain to aid his communist comrades in the struggle. He listed his address as 246/8 East 51st Brooklyn, New York and received his passport on May 25, 1937. He sailed aboard the MV <em>Georgic</em> on June 12, 1937, and arrived in Spain two weeks later. Once he arrived he registered for the Spanish Communist Party and trained with the Battalion of Instruction Tarazona in the city of Albacete to serve as a front-line infantryman. However, due to his technical skills, and before entering combat, Gerber was transferred into the Service Sanitaire, which was a front-line surgical unit. He became a trained mechanic, truck driver, and sterilizer, and served as an ambulance driver. Members of the International Brigades who had the skill to drive and maintain medical vehicles, such as Gerber, would work within the American Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy (AMBASD) as chauffeurs. Gerber picked up an ambulance on August 6, 1937, at Port Bou for the First Evac Group. He was commissioned at Villa Paz with other ambulance drivers, and it was at this time the Group of Evacuation became a formal military unit. This unit notably drove towards the Aragon front in an attempt to assist in the battle of Belchite at Quinto.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBernard Gerber continued to serve within the First Evacuation Group until late 1938 when it became clear that the Nationalist forces were poised for victory. Gerber returned to the United States on December 20, 1938, aboard the RMS <em>Ausonia</em>. He later moved to Deerfield Beach, Florida, dying in February 1979 at the age of 67.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>On November 18, 1903, Nathan David Kapilner was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. Kapilner was a Jewish-American in the XV International Brigade of the 35th Division who volunteered to fight for the Spanish Republic. According to The Jewish Virtual Library (A Project of AICE), Kapilner was recorded to have resided in a small apartment in an area called Borough Park (also known as Boro Park) in southwest Brooklyn, specifically, 964 49th Street, Brooklyn NY. Borough Park was known to be one of the most predominantly Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish communities in the United States, and it still remains to be so today.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot much else is known about Kapilner&rsquo;s early life, but it is recorded that he participated in a Jewish-centered education program while attending high school in New York. Yeshivas Etz Chaim/Etz Hayim, or the Hebrew Institute of Boro Park was the school that Kapilner is speculated to have attended, as it was the first Jewish day school in Borough Park founded in the very early 1900s. There is no information on whether he attended college or not. However, it is known that Kapilner held a job in the textile and leather workers area. During this time in the early to mid-1900s, Jewish immigrants held a tight grip on the garment factory business in New York. Up to three quarters of the garment manufacturing factories and buildings/businesses were known to be made up of Jewish immigrant workers, even as unemployment levels fluctuated from the aftermath of the Great Depression. Similarly, Kapilner worked as a ladies coat manufacturer in a garment and textile/leather factory after high school to support himself. He is speculated to have been a part of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) before joining the CPUSA, that had been influencing the flow of the ILGWU with frictional divisions between international leaders of each party.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the news of the coup d&#39;etat that was carried out against the Spanish Republic in 1936, Kapliner found himself taking responsibility as a volunteer and a fighter in the Lincoln Battalion as a part of the XV International Brigade. Kapilner&rsquo;s strong Jewish identification as well as his overall involvement in the Jewish community in Borough Park ever since he was young inspired him and many others to be among the many Jewish volunteers who entered the Spanish War to help resist antisemitism along with the fascist and nazist values that the Nationalists carried. Out of the approximate three thousand volunteers from the United States Lincoln Brigade, Kapilner was one of the thousand Jewish volunteers who felt a European bond to fight against the anti fascist cause despite his American education. Furthermore, the Lincoln Battalion was decently integrated with members who fought for various reasons, consisting of both African Americans and Jewish members, where most participants were brought together by similar viewpoints on anti-facist activism and communist perspectives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe International Brigades is known to have been created by the Communist International. Kapilner himself was a member of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA). The Communist Party in Paris led the recruitments of the International Brigades, where Kapilner and his fellow volunteers first went to Paris before going to Spain. Although joining the International Brigades was not required as a part of the Communist Party, Kapilner&rsquo;s participation and ties to the CPUSA, as well as his willingness to be a volunteer for the cause, landed him in the Lincoln Battalion. On May 8, 1937, a year after the war started, Kapilner set sail on the American Importer to reach Spain. He was also one of the many members who were taken to the Albacete headquarters of the International Brigade and separated as different Battalion members and sent to different warzones. Furthermore, this was during the period where communists and the POUM faced abrasions against each other with the communist propaganda surging through the effects of the ongoing war.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKapilner actually passed away before the infamous Ebro Offensive (Battle of Ebro) in 1938, often confused with Fuentes de Ebro and the smaller battles and sieges against the Nationalists in their attempt to seize the Basque County area. October marks the month when the Nationalists finally completed their seize of power in the Basque County and the Northern parts of Spain with the fall of Gij&oacute;n late October. On October 10th, 1937, the Republican Army along with the International Brigades, including Kapilner&rsquo;s group, desperately started to launch new attacks South Ebro to try to open the way for the attack on Zaragoza.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKapilner and the other volunteers fought at Fuentes de Ebro on October 13, 1937, where Russian tanks were used during the attack plan but fell apart when the inexperienced battalions failed to coordinate their attacks with the tanks. Kapilner was killed in action at the age of 34 in this battle, where the casualties for the Republican and the XVth Brigade were especially high. Soon after the fall of Gij&oacute;n in Northern Spain, the Republican government relocated to Barcelona from Valencia to regroup again. But Kapilner&rsquo;s bravery remains on the battlefield of Fuentes de Ebro as a sacrifice, along with many other men who gave their lives and deserve to be remembered for this honorable cause.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Leo Solodkin was born on August 3rd, 1912 in New York City to Harry Solodkin, a shopkeeper, and Anna Solodkin. Prior to the war, Leo Solodkin studied Civil Engineering at City College of New York (CCNY) and was employed as a construction estimator. He was a part of FAECT, the Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists, and Technicians. FAECT was a union based in New York City that formed after splitting off from the International Federation of Technical Engineers, Architects and Draftsmen&#39;s Union for &#39;excessive radicalism&#39; while protesting low wages during the Great Depression. FAECT tried to have a presence in technical colleges across NYC in an attempt to give students exposure to the union and have them join once they had graduated. FAECT eventually affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). Many FAECT members were communists and FAECT was accused of having soviet spies. Solodkin was also a member of the Young Communists League which was rebranded as the Young Workers League of America to appeal to a wider audience. Solodkin participated in the Harlem Youth Club and American Student Union, the latter containing many communist members. He was also one of many other Jews who chose to fight in the Spanish Civil War.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLeo Solodkin sailed to Spain on May 8th, 1937 via the American Importer. By way of France, he arrived in Spain on June 1st of 1937. Solodkin wrote as his reason for joining the war &ldquo;The fight against fascism&rdquo; and that his father&rsquo;s communist ideologies influenced his own. From August 7th-17th, 1937 he was a part of the Lincoln-Washington Battalion. He then transferred to the XV Brigade Scouts until December of 1937. From December of 1937 to August of 1938 Solodkin served as a topographer in the 58th Battalion of the XV Brigade. As a topographer, or topographic engineer, his job was to turn reconnaissance from scouting missions into topographic maps. Solodkin served at Quinto, Belchite, Teruel, and Retreats and the Ebro Offensive. Belchite, a small town situated a few Kilometers away from the City of Zaragoza, was a two week long but intense battle resulting in near complete destruction of the town. The battle of Teruel lasted over two months during the winter of 1937-38. Casualties were extremely heavy on both sides and control of the city changed several times. The suffering of the Republican Soldiers was immense, as they were under-equipped and over exposed to the elements, during what was the coldest winter of the past two decades. On August 16th, 1938 Solodkin was wounded in his right arm during the battle of Sierra Pandols which was a part of the larger Battle for the Ebro River Valley and surrounding hills. The Ebro Offensive-the longest and largest battle of the Spanish Civil War-was the last battle for the International Brigades.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUpon leaving the Brigade in October of 1938 Solodkin was described as &ldquo;steady&rdquo;, &ldquo;willing&rdquo;, &ldquo;moral&rdquo;, and &ldquo;a good comrade&rdquo;. Solodkin returned home to New York City on December 20, 1938, aboard the Ausonia. He became an electrician and not many years later, after the start of America&#39;s involvement in World War Two, he served in the U.S. Army from 1942-1946. After WWII, Solodkin created a stationary store and newspaper delivery service with his brother. Prior to his death in 2001, Leo Solodkin had two children with his wife, Ada Solodkin, and four grandchildren.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Edward K. Barsky was born on June 6, 1895. He grew up in New York, with his parents and five other siblings, and in his youth attended Townsend Harris High School in Queens. Like his father and brothers, who were all doctors, he entered the medical practice. He attended the City College of New York, then the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. After graduating from the College of Physicians, he studied abroad in Europe--he visited Paris, Berlin, and Vienna. When he came back to the United States, he rose from being an intern, then visiting staff, then surgeon at Beth Israel Hospital, which his own father founded many years prior. He joined the Communist Party in 1935. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, Edward Barsky was an assistant surgeon, but he left his position to go help the cause. According to his passport, at the time he lived at 127 West South Street, NYC. He departed January 16, 1937, arriving in Spain in February. He was among the first doctors to travel to Spain to provide medical aid, departing only a few weeks after the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. During the War he helped to create the AMB (American Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy), and was a leading figure in directing staff and setting up hospitals. He was also head of the American Ambulance Unit. At one point, he and his staff were working 50 hours straight. He returned to the United States just once, but during this time he went on a speaking tour and raised &ldquo;hundreds of thousands of dollars&rdquo; and supplies for the cause. When he went back to Spain, he was named Surgeon General of International Sanitary Service, and was responsible for thousands of medical volunteers from all over the world. After the War, Barsky returned to Beth Israel Hospital. He married University of Wisconsin alum Vita Lauter, and together they had a daughter named Angela. He became the chairman of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, providing aid to Spanish Republican refugees who were suffering in the poor conditions of French refugee camps. While he was in office, the Committee raised nearly $400,000 within two years. He eventually found himself being investigated, and in June 1947 was convicted by the House of UnAmerican Activities for &ldquo;contempt of Congress&rdquo;, because the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee refused to turn in their financial records to the government. After three years of appeals, he was sentenced to six months in prison, serving time in the Federal Penitentiary (Petersburg, Virginia), and had to pay a fine of $500. He ended up serving five months. After serving, Barsky had his medical license suspended for six months--despite years of appeals--because, in the words of Judge William O. Douglas, &ldquo;When a doctor cannot save lives in America because he is opposed to Franco in Spain, it is time to call a halt and look critically at the neurosis that has possessed us.&rdquo; However, Barsky received support on an international level, many sending people even writing letters of sympathy-- &ldquo;Eddie is a saint,&rdquo; Ernest Hemingway once wrote to Milton Wolff, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where we put our saints in this country--in jail.&rdquo; Throughout the rest of his life, Edward Barsky remained committed and involved in progressive politics. He was involved in the New York Labor movement, and in the 1960s he served in the Medical Committee for Human Rights, which provided for the medical needs of the civil rights movement in the South. At the end of his life, Barsky was the consulting&nbsp; surgeon at Beth Israel Hospital. He died in University Hospital on February 11, 1975, at the age of 78. (An obituary was written about him in the NY Times that week.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Vincent Usera was born on December 8th, 1908 in Ponce, Puerto Rico. He arrived in the United States at the age of 1 with his mother, father, and sister on April 16th, 1910 in Manhattan. When he was 17 years old, he joined the US Marines and initially served in China&rsquo;s Yangtze River (along with other unnamed locations in the region) and in Nicaragua when the marines occupied the country to battle Augusto Sandino. In Nicaragua, he fought against the Sandinista ideology which was similar to communism but with some aspects of fascism, such as nationalism. His career came to an end when he was involved in an affair with the wife of someone with a higher rank than him and was kicked out of the military; after his departure, it became knows that he was sexually involved with the wives of other officers as well. Afterward, he lived in Rhode Island with his cousin where he worked as an insurance broker and became involved in show business: a 1934 Newport newspaper article stated that Usera was the house manager of a local theatre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He then moved back down to New York City to his address on 280 Riverside Drive so he could sign up to volunteer in the war, planning to re-enlist in the US military. Even though they were oblivious to this information, communist officials in New York City were skeptical of his interest in the war, considering that he had no affiliation with left-wing politics and was not known to be a politically opinionated person, so it was written in his notes to keep a close eye on him. However, they were still delighted to have someone with his level of expertise and combat experience on the side of the Republic. On March 29th, 1937, he received his passport to Spain and sailed to Spain on April 28th, 1937 where he eventually arrived a month later on May 30th, 1937.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he first arrived in Spain, it was noted that he would always be nervous and uncertain of his statements when it came to discussions centered around leftist ideology. As a result, it was a common theory that he was sent by the Army as an intelligence agent to keep a close eye on the left-wingers and their names; another theory was that he spied on the Brigades on his own accord to restore his reputation in the US military and regain their favor. To combat these, Usera boasted that he was friends with a well-known Washington labor activist&mdash;since this claim was made in Spain, there was no way to verify if his friend existed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He initially served in the Washington Brigade as a commander, but Steve Nelson was unhappy with his performance in the war&mdash;since he was known to disappear in the middle of major battles&mdash;and transferred him to a base in Tarazona where he became one of the most renowned infantry instructors. Steve Nelson was worried that he had been planted in the war and told Cecil Eby, a professor at the University of Michigan, that Usera always left his post without permission when help was needed; in his diary, Merriman wrote that Usera &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t pretend to be a brave man.&rdquo; However, he did prove useful as a trainer as he helped train the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, a battalion of Canadians. Before going to battle in Albacete, it was noted that Usera was &ldquo;placed in the hospital with venereal disease&rdquo; so he had to be held back in Tarazona until he was fit to serve. He served in Albacete and then disappeared to Barcelona where he was arrested and sent to Camp Lukas for trying to leave Spain without permission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, he moved up the ranks from a trainer to company commander to Oliver Law&rsquo;s second-in-command. At the battle of Brunete, he disappeared and wasn&rsquo;t heard of by any member of the battalion. Conveniently, this was before Law&rsquo;s death in the battle. The next record of him was in Antwerp, Belgium on May 25th, 1938 where he boarded the S.S. Black Hawk to New York where he arrived on June 5th, 1938. He then vanished temporarily until 1939 where he gave a lecture titled &ldquo;Some Lessons from the Spanish War&rdquo; at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland where he covered tactics, weapons, training, and defense measures. He then resumed his military career: in 1943, he was a major; in 1944, an executive officer of a European infantry battalion; then he became involved in military intelligence&mdash;he worked under Dwight D. Eisenhower, a NATO commander. He retired in 1963 at the age of 54 as a full colonel with a Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster and left the country to live in Franco&rsquo;s Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Child of Nathan Sall and Bessie Beck Sall, Bernard Sall was born in NYC on the 14th of August 1914. Bernard Sall lived in Brooklyn under 2 addresses, 1837 71st Street, and 6301 Bay Parkway. His parents were immigrants from Russia. Being a first generation American with immigrant parents Bernard Sall&rsquo;s identity was one of assimilation between Russian culture and the new liberating culture of America. &ldquo;The American Dream&rdquo;, something that Bernard&rsquo;s parents had come to America in search of all seemed to come crumbling down with the presence of World War I shortly after Bernard was born and later on the Great Depression. Bessie Sall was unemployed and Nathan Sall worked as an industrial cutter making 1200 a month which wasn&rsquo;t much to live off of. Due to the crumbling of this &ldquo;American Dream&rdquo;, Bernard didn&rsquo;t find an incentive behind studying just for it to amount to nothing hence why he had only studied in University and night courses for 2 years. He didn&rsquo;t get a degree so his highest level of education remained the 4 years of high school he had completed. He didn&rsquo;t have an interest in much other than utility hence why he became an electrician making 600 a month.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a result of the Great Depression, Bernard developed a resentful perspective towards Capitalism. Seeking an escape from the prevailing misery within the United States, he made the decision to enlist in the U.S. army in 1931, serving for approximately one year. Following his army experience, Bernard chose to pursue work as a gunsmith and later transitioned into the role of a telephonist. Despite maintaining his negative opinions on capitalism, he became affiliated with the Young Communist League (YCL). Despite President FDR&#39;s enactment of the neutrality acts, Bernard and many others, particularly in New York, made the decision to involve themselves in the emerging Spanish Civil War. Aligned with the YCL, Bernard embarked on a journey to Spain aboard the SS Champlain, intending to join other organizations supporting the Republican troops in their fight against Franco and the nationalists. The voyage itself presented challenges, as Bernard and fellow volunteers had to adopt disguises to conceal their true intentions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArriving in Spain on January 28, 1937, Bernard quickly affiliated himself with the Spanish Communist party with ease as he was already affiliated with the communist party given that he was a member of the YCL. Bernard had also become affiliated with the XIII Brigade, the XV Brigade, and the 86th Brigade. Due to having experience in combat from being in the US army for some time, Bernard had no problem with the rudimentary training in contrast to many other young inexperienced volunteers. The only difficulty Bernard had was understanding the French instructions. Being affiliated with multiple International brigades, Bernard was involved in some of the biggest conflicts of the Spanish Civil War. Following the failed Cordoba offensive, morale was low due to the youth and inexperience however this same youth amongst the International Brigades was what motivated them to enter the Battle of Brunete which became known as one of the most decisive clashes in the Spanish Civil War. Starting as an offensive, the Republicans and Bernard had made significant progress which was quickly counter attacked by Franco who put the Republicans on the losing side yet again as the Nationalists had regained Brunete. Bernard had survived through his experience but was also witness to many of his new young comrades dying. When Franco had quit on Brunete and resumed the conquest of the Biscay Enclave, Bernard and the rest of the Republicans claimed victory as they had gained a small amount of land. Bernard and the other experienced people of the International Brigade knew that this was a bitter loss. The loss of 19,000 troops, a significant amount being from the International Brigades, left a huge sense of guilt on Bernard&rsquo;s mind. Many young men, the same age as himself, had died due to their inexperience. Later on, when Bernard was stationed in Valencia, he experienced the Levante offensive in which Franco had tried to take the city of Valencia from the Republicans but failed due to their dogged determination. The unity and communist values of equity were something that Bernard had truly experienced and valued during these times as it led to some victories for the Republicans such as the aforementioned Levante Offensive failure. The major battle right before Bernard had finally decided to go back home was the battle of Ebro, the longest and largest battle of the Spanish Civil War. Crossing the Ebro river with other young men of the international brigades seemingly somewhat more experienced due to some battles fought, the Republicans tasted victory as the offensive on Corebera had worked. However, something that had a big role in Bernard deciding to go back home after this was the sheer destruction that was faced by the Republicans. The Nationalists had decided to strike back and this resulted in the Republicans being on the defensive. Bernard experienced exhaustion and pure terror in the face of seeing so many of his friends dying. Although he had seen death before, the death he experienced in the Battle of Ebro was unparalleled. The whole battle ended in Nationalist victory and a sense of hopelessness amongst not only Bernard but also many other Republicans as so much was lost yet such little progress was made. Bernard had survived due to his experience but could no longer fight and decided to return back to America on the 20th of December 1938 on the SS Ausonia.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Paul Goldberg (who also went by Pincus Goldberg) was born on December 8th, 1914 in New York City. He lived at 1298 Brook Avenue, Bronx in the Morrisania area. During the early 1900s Morrisania was undergoing a large influx of primarily European immigrants who moved into tenement buildings in the area. During this wave of immigration these immigrants were mostly from Eastern Europe where importantly, there were many Jewish people who wanted to leave Eastern Europe. It&rsquo;s likely that Paul&rsquo;s parents were part of this wave of Eastern European and largely Jewish immigration. Growing up in New York during the 1920s and 30s was not easy for Paul. Anti-semitism was still a common occurrence in many parts of the United States and New York City too. When Paul was just 14 years old the Stock market crashed sparking the Great Depression. Paul would have been witness to many people around him losing their jobs and falling into financial hardship. Paul claims that he himself did work as a clerk but also listed himself as having a profession in first aid. Other sources also claim that he worked as a nurse or a doctor at some point. Regardless Paul was better off than most during the Depression, and the suffering of those around Paul would have been obvious.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the early 1930s word of the rise of fascism reached the United States along with fascism&rsquo;s hatred of the Jewish people. So when Paul heard about the fight against Fascism in Spain he was motivated to join the effort to defeat fascism and in a way defend his people. By 1937 Paul would be affiliated with the communist party, a decision that probably stemmed from what he witnessed during the great depression coupled with the party&rsquo;s efforts to organize Americans to fight in Spain. Paul would get his passport on May 26th, 1937, and would sail for France on June 2nd on board the RMS Aquitania with many other American volunteers. Notably, the American government threatened to revoke the passports of Americans who went to fight in Spain so Paul would have only had his passport for a short time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPaul would arrive in Spain via the municipality of Setcases on June 18th. Paul would start using the nickname Pincus during his time in Spain. Paul would join the 15th international brigade as a soldier and was initially attached to the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion and went to a training camp in Tarazona from June 29th to August 7th. The Mackenzie-Papineua battalion was a primarily Canadian battalion. Afterward, he would be attached to the Lincoln-Washington Battalion until August 20th. Then he would go to the English battalion which he would serve with until October 14th. Some other sources say that Paul served with the signal platoon or transmisiones in Spanish. The signal platoon served to transmit communications between parts of the Republican forces, within the battalion it allowed the battalion to communicate with its companies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPaul would participate in the battle of Belchite which were a series of operations by Republican forces in the region of Aragon in an attempt to slow down nationalist advances in northern Spain. Within this battle, Paul would fight at the villages of Quinto and Mediana. Paul would later fight in the Battle of Fuentes de Ebro in late 1937. During this battle, Paul would be wounded in his left hand on October 14th. For his injury, Paul was sent to Benicassim Hospital from October 19th, 1937 to January 15th, 1938. He would be transferred to Mercia Hospital the next day and would stay there until March 25th.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAround this time the Nationalists would begin the Aragon offensive which would end up splitting the Republican-held territories into two by the middle of April. Paul would fight during the retreat of the 15th in this battle. Afterward, the International soldiers marched through Catalonia toward France. Paul managed to successfully cross the border into France. Paul and about 50 other Abraham Lincoln brigade volunteers would take the RMS Ausonia from Le Havre, France back to New York arriving on December 20th, 1938. Paul would later go on to continue the fight against fascism by serving in the American Armed Forces during World War 2 as a nurse.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Irving Frankel was born in 1907 in Brooklyn, New York. His parents were Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire (now Russia). They were part of a generation that fled Eastern Europe around the turn of the last century to escape antisemitism, which had manifested in the form of pogroms throughout the region. However, his parents were not religious, and his father was a well-educated man who, according to Irving Frankel, worked in the &quot;real estate insurance industry&quot; after coming to America.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrankel had a positive relationship with his family and was afforded a relatively comfortable childhood due to his father&rsquo;s work, even though they resided in the poor neighborhood of Brownsville. Frankel was known to have lived at 202 Herzl Street in Brownsville, although it is unclear if this was his childhood home. Brownsville was a mostly Jewish and Italian community at the time, and the Frankels were surrounded by impoverished garment workers, peddlers, and the unemployed. The family pressured young Irving Frankel to prioritize his education, and he even became the high school newspaper editor. However, he soon began working at the age of 16, whereupon he dropped out of regular high school and took night school classes in New Lots, Brooklyn, to complete his secondary education. He then went to City College for 2 years but did not complete his degree, citing personal laziness as a factor in his academic shortcomings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSoon after, Frankel began attending political gatherings in his neighborhood. At the time, Brownsville was a hub for progressive thought. Frankel frequented large public talks given by Abraham &ldquo;Abe&rdquo; Osheroff, a communist activist who later fought in Spain, on the corner of Hopkinson Avenue (now Thomas S. Boyland Street) and Pitkin Avenue. Frankel ended up joining the Communist Party of the United States in 1936 and becoming a passionate member. In the summer of the same year, the Spanish Civil War began as nationalist rebels failed to swiftly realize a coup d&#39;&eacute;tat. Frankel stated that as soon as the news came out, he viewed the conflict as a war of &ldquo;good guys against bad guys.&rdquo; After reading, seeing, and hearing various reports, he thought, &ldquo;[I have] got to go to Spain.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn early 1937, he applied for a passport but was not granted one. The government mentioned his background (political affiliation) as the reason. Frankel recalled being distraught over this, as &ldquo;everybody [he] knew was going to Spain, and [he] was jealous&rdquo;. In July 1938, he managed to stow away on the SS Manhattan with the help of longshoreman Edward &ldquo;Frenchy&rdquo; Robinson. He had never been on a ship before, and the journey was worsened by the minimal food he received as a stowaway. But after 6 days, Irving Frankel landed in France, along with Frenchy Robinson, a volunteer named Alex Weinerman, and others destined for Spain. After staying at a hotel in Paris for several nights, Frankel traveled by train to the city of Perpignan, on the southern border of France. From here, he and several others spent a night trekking across the Pyrenees Mountains.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrankel arrived in Spain on July 26, 1938. He took part in a one-week training program, which taught him rudimentary combat skills like using a rifle. The instruction was in Spanish, but he picked up the core ideas, after which he was off to the front. Most of the fighting that Frankel participated in was during the Ebro Offensive, specifically in battles at the Serra de P&agrave;ndols and the Serra de Cavalls, which are two mountain ranges along the Ebro River. He crossed the Ebro River by rowboat and later described the volunteer fighters as being woefully inexperienced: &ldquo;Like idiots, we fired [with rifles] at some planes coming over.&rdquo; He was exposed to gruesome sights during the Ebro Offensive: two acquaintances from the ship to France were killed in action with Frankel nearby, and Alex Weinerman had his leg blown off by a mortar shell right in front of Frankel. Reflecting on his experiences in Spain, Frankel noted that he only saw the bitter war-torn aspects and not much else of the country. He met very few civilians, but poverty and Catholicism stood out to him. Ultimately, the Spanish Civil War left Frankel feeling cynical, a sentiment that was justified by the failure of the Ebro Offensive and the Republican cause as a whole.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter five months in Spain, he returned to the United States aboard the SS Ausonia on December 20, 1938. In America, he received welfare and was supported by a worker&rsquo;s alliance. He spent a short time working in the Soviet Pavilion at the 1939 New York World&#39;s Fair. When America joined WW2 in December 1941, he got licensed to be a seaman and began working as a Merchant Marine sailing transporting materials across the Atlantic Ocean. It was dangerous work, and he was lucky to avoid death after a torpedo hit his ship on a voyage. After WW2, Frankel got a job running the Seaman&rsquo;s Club for the United Seamen&#39;s Service. He lived a quiet life thereafter (working various sea-related jobs), but was subject to occasional U.S. government surveillance because of his political past. He had already become disillusioned with the Communist Party, and quietly cut off his connections with it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike many others who served in the Abraham Lincoln Brigades, Frankel was an everyday man with a left-wing inclination and a strong sense of morality. When asked near the end of his life what he felt about the failed fight against fascism in Spain, he replied clearly that &ldquo;it had to be done.&rdquo; Having lived a long and fruitful life, Irving Frankel passed away in 1997.</p>\r\n",

What is known is that he lived in New York under the address of 25 Mckibben Street, which is located east of South Williamsburg and southeast of Williamsburg. He was also noted to live at 101 Polanski Street, which is not an address currently listed in New York but draws similarities to 101 Pulaski Street, which is in an area right above the neighborhood of Bed-Stuy and right below the neighborhood of Williamsburg. There is little information about why he moved from New Bedford, Massachusetts to New York City but it can be assumed that the opportunities presented in New York played a strong role in his decision.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor aspiring volunteers for the Spanish Civil War, the United States government made it very difficult for prospective volunteers to make their way to Spain. Many countries had signed a non-intervention pact, vouching to stay out of the war in Spain, making it exceptionally hard to receive any clearance to go there. To circumvent this &quot;blockade&quot; of access to Spain, many aspiring volunteers took alternative paths, such as taking ships to other countries and making the trek to Spain from there. It was common for the United States to refuse to issue passports for these trips, so many volunteers were quoted as going for other reasons, such as research or business purposes. In the case of Gross, he first arrived in Massanet, Spain, where he then went on to Figueres on March 6th, 1938. Figueres was a known meeting place for members of the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War and held the concluding meetings of the war in its infamous Sant Ferran&#39;s Castle. By March 11th, 1938, he was in the city of Albacete and would eventually join the XV International Brigade. The brigade was nicknamed the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and was formed and put together in the city of Albacete.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe XV International Brigade was made up of various battalions that came together from all over the world. Gross, alongside his brigade, went into battle at the Battle of Ebro, which was the longest and most drawn-out battle of the civil war. The nationalists would go on to win this battle, with Gross lucky enough to make it out alive where many Americans and international volunteers were unable to do so. As Gross was part of the XV Brigade, he would play a crucial part in the siege of Gandesa. On the first of August, the XV International Brigade attacked Gandesa, suffering a huge amount of casualties. Part of the Republican assault failure was attributed to the dominance the Nationalists had in the air and as a whole while receiving mixed signals from their general. The XV brigade showed tremendous strength allowing the Republican forces to regroup and retreat to the Ebro River.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe would go on to become a cabo and also be part of the &quot;estado mayor&quot; during his short stint in Spain fighting for independence. Estado mayor stood for &quot;general staff,&quot; and it is not clear what his duties in this council specifically were, but what we do know is that this staff helped carry out many different types of administrative and logistical tasks for the people who may have been higher up in command.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGross wouldn&rsquo;t last long in Spain, quickly making his way back to the Ausonia on December 20th, 1938, and soon after that, the United States. This all happened not long after his deployment earlier that same year, on March 6th, 1938. He would go on to die in Monsey, New York, in April of 1987.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Griffith Bowen Washburn was born on 18 July 1913 in New York City to white Christian parents. His parents were both born in America&mdash; his father, Phillip Carter Washburn, worked at a hospital and was born in Ohio; his mother, Doris Washburn, was born in New Jersey. Washburn grew up in a post-WWI society, living through the 1920s. He was part of the generation that saw the homogenization of American culture through the rapid commercialization. The culture at the time was thriving, with the Great Migration creating a rich identity in New York City in the form of the Harlem Renaissance. Thus, Washburn grew up in the center of jazz and literature, all the while organized crime was rampant during prohibition. To the outside world, America seemed to have it all, and Europeans continued immigrating to escape the post-war Europe that was heavily in debt.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWashburn lived in Greystone Park, Morris, NJ, where his father worked in the New Jersey State Hospital. At age 16, as the result of Americans having trusted the economy so vehemently, Washburn experienced the Great Depression following the Stock Market Crash on 29 October 1929. Not only that, but there was also the Great Dust Bowl that affected the agricultural industries in the US. Other countries began taking their currency off the gold standard, and with depletion of gold, the US dollar experienced inflation as its value remained tied to a fixed rate. These instances further made it difficult for Washburn&rsquo;s family to survive in late 1920s America. Washburn saw the decline of the American youth culture, one that had become difficult to sustain. In times of economic hardships, people are drawn to socialism and other welfare benefits. In spite of the First Red Scare after WWI, socialism and communism appealed to Americans affected by the Depression, including Washburn.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1931, Washburn left New Jersey for Cambridge, Massachusetts, to attend Harvard University for his undergraduate studies. In 1933, at the worst of the Depression, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected president and enacted a series of reforms and recovery programs under the New Deal to decrease unemployment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWashburn graduated from Harvard in 1935, impressive especially given the time. When he returned to New York, he attended Columbia University for his graduate studies. He lived at 531 W124 Street in Harlem, right by the Columbia campus. Washburn was there when he learned of the Spanish Civil War, which had begun in 1936. Despite President Roosevelt issuing that the US would remain neutral, the American public closely followed the conflict. Not only did the Depression waver Washburn&rsquo;s faith in capitalism, but as an intellectual, he also wanted to fight for democracy and against the fascist takeover of Spain. As a result, he aligned himself with the socialists. Inspired by the selfless Americans that had gone to Spain regardless of the president&rsquo;s neutrality, in June 1937, Washburn boarded the Lancastria by pretending to be a cruise passenger to join the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (XV Brigade). To Washburn, fighting the Spanish Civil War was symbolic of a larger cause as an American protecting other people&rsquo;s right to democracy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen Washburn arrived in Setcases, Spain, by the Pyrenees in mid-July, he joined the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion (named after the two leaders of the Canadian Rebellions of 1837&ndash;1838), which consisted of Canadian, American, and British volunteers. While the British and American volunteers were mostly college students and intellectuals like Washburn, the Canadian volunteers were wholly of the working class that had been inspired by the failure of capitalism in the Great Depression.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the Mac-Pap Battalion, Washburn fought in the Zaragoza Offensive, which was largely a failure because the Republican front was only able to advance a few kilometers. He also fought in the Battle of Teruel from December 1937 to February 1938. The Nationalists had taken Teruel at the start of the Spanish Civil War, but by January, the Francoists surrendered the city. However, the victory was only short-lived, as Franco led a counter-offensive starting in mid-January, taking back Teruel. By then, the Republican army was exhausted of resources, and started the Great Retreats, known as the Aragon Offensive to the Nationalists. Lastly, Washburn participated in the Battle of the Ebro from July to September 1938, which was a decisive Nationalist victory. By the end 1938, Washburn was still valiantly fighting along the frontier until Prime Minister Negrin announced on 21 September 1938 the forced withdrawal of the International Brigades.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter fighting in Spain for 18 months (around 1 year and a half), Washburn reluctantly returned to New York from Le Havre, France, on the ship Ausonia on 20 December 1938. He was only 25 years old. He returned to live with his parents and occasionally helped out at the hospital. When WWII broke out, Washburn joined the US Army on 29 November 1940 and became a Technical Sergeant in 712 Military Police Battalion. Although some veterans of the Spanish Civil War were prevented from serving in WWII, Washburn was able to bypass that through his dedication to fighting for democracy. As a member of the military police, Washburn was responsible for policing and ensuring law enforcement within the military itself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen WWII ended, Washburn was honorably discharged at age 32 on 13 December 1945 and worked a variety of jobs throughout New York and New Jersey. He met Bertha Doris Kelsall, a white American woman from Pennsylvania. It is debated whether the two were officially married or not. In 1946, Washburn moved upstate to Lee Drive in Niagara Falls, NY, and worked as a sales clerk. He lived with Kelsall and their son, Phillip Carter Washburn Jr. (named after Washburn&rsquo;s father), was born in 1946. Two years later, Phillip Washburn Sr. passed away in 1948.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1954, Washburn passed away in his residence in Niagara Falls at the young age of 41 to unknown causes. He currently rests at Riverdale Cemetery in Lewiston, New York, with a Christian Latin cross symbolizing his faith. At such a young age, Washburn accomplished a great deal; from graduating Harvard, attending Columbia, then fighting in both the Spanish Civil War and WWII, his efforts for freedom and democracy should not be forgotten.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Jos&eacute; Luis Herrera Sotolongo was born in 1909, according to the US Census. Whether this is accurate or not remains to be seen: to this day, there remain multiple discrepancies between records, some stating that by the time of his enlistment in 1937, he was twenty-eight years old, but others stating he was thirty-five. While his exact date of birth remains unknown, he was born in Cuba and immigrated to the US in 1929. Within a few years of immigrating to the US, Sotolongo became an active political participant of the Cuban immigrant community, becoming a member of the Julio A. Mella Club alongside his career as a painter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Julio A. Mella Club was created by Cuban activists and political exiles in 1931 who had left their country in opposition to Cuba&rsquo;s dictator, Gerado Machado y Morales. Otherwise known as the &ldquo;anti-Machado struggle&rdquo;, the Club found support among Harlem&rsquo;s Cuban community, marked for its anti-fascist beliefs and organizing. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, many members of the Mella Club, who had been personally affected by the anti-Machado struggle would comprise one of the many groups of American volunteers who ended up serving in the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sotolongo, alongside many other Cuban peers, was recruited for the Centuria Antonio Guiteras (named for Cuban politician Antonio Guiteras), intended to be a Cuban unit to serve in the war. The US Communist Party paid to equip and transport each group of volunteers. The journey to Spain was long and difficult: the first group of volunteers left on the <em>Champlain</em> on January 5, 1937, where they landed in Le Havre, a town in France. They then took a boat train to Paris, another train to Perpignan, which was on the French border and after a bus ride to cross the Pyrenees, they would take another train to Albacete, Barcelona. While it is not explicitly stated, Sotolongo was most likely to be in this first group of volunteers, as according to his record, he arrived in Spain on February 10th, 1937.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After training with the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, the Centuria Guiteras was integrated into the battalion as Section 3, Company 1. Sotolongo himself would continue to serve with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade at Jarama, Brunete, and Aragon. By his comrades and officers, he was referred to as a &ldquo;good [Cuban] comrade&rdquo; but &ldquo;bad physically&rdquo;, a &ldquo;hard worker&rdquo;, and one that came with a &ldquo;good recommendation from the Brigade&rdquo; with a good &ldquo;political outlook. Thanks to his efforts, Sotolongo would eventually reach the rank of Commandant during his service, although this was short-lived, as not long afterwards, he would be injured at Aragon. After getting wounded, he would wait in Tarazona, a town in Aragon, for a little over a year, before being repatriated back to Albacete in January 1938.&nbsp; After receiving treatment, he would then return to the US on May 27th, 1938 on the <em>SS Cuba</em> to Key West, Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This would not mark the end of Sotolongo&rsquo;s dedication to anti-fascism. In fact, he would go on to serve in WWII, like many other Cuban veterans, choosing to embody his beliefs and values to the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Initially while doing research, I stumbled across another Jos&eacute; L. Herrera Sotolongo who, during the war, notably served as a surgeon for the Spanish Republican Army and was writer Ernest Hemmingway&rsquo;s personal doctor. I initially thought they were the same person, the more I read about Hemmingway&rsquo;s Sotolongo, I realized the details of his life didn&rsquo;t match up with this Sotolongo. They both served in different battalions, performed different duties, were born in different countries (Hemmingway&rsquo;s being born in Madrid, while this Sotolongo was born in Cuba), and Hemmingway&#39;s Sotolongo stayed in Spain a lot longer (he wasn&#39;t injured and didn&#39;t receive repatriation). Side note, but the eerie thing is that when comparing their photographs, the two look very similar!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p><br />\r\nPhilip Mandelblatt was born on January 25th, 1911 to Jewish immigrants Samuel and Betty Mandelblatt, who were among a large wave of Jewish immigrants in the early 20th century fleeing the anti-Semitism of Tsarist Russia and its pogroms. His father Sam worked in the garment industry as a presser while his mother stayed at home. Growing up in a crowded household with several siblings, his early childhood was defined by the struggle Jewish immigrants faced in the US. His family lived at 149 Monroe Street in the Lower East Side. This address no longer exists, suggesting that the Mandelblatts lived in a tenement that was later demolished as part of the city&rsquo;s &ldquo;urban renewal&rdquo; program to create new public housing. Mandelblatt&rsquo;s background suggests that like many immigrants, his tenement was poorly constructed, ventilated, and crowded. His family later moved up to the Upper East Side by Philip&rsquo;s teenage years, being part of the movement of Jewish immigrants north, successfully escaping the poor conditions of the tenements. By 1925, the Mandelblatts lived at 205 East 100th Street, into what remains a small apartment, but a huge improvement from his life on the Lower East Side. He studied up until his first year of high school, suggesting that as in many working class families, he had to drop out to make a living.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhilip shuffled around in odd jobs as a painter and newspaper delivery man before becoming a stevedore, loading and unloading goods on New York&#39;s docks for one of the many large companies that housed its headquarters in the Merchants&rsquo; Building on 693 Broadway. Working among some of New York&#39;s poorest, Philip&rsquo;s upbringing and his own difficult life may have influenced him to join the Young Communist League in 1934 as it neared the height of its popularity due to the growing worldwide anti-fascist movement. He eventually joined the Communist Party in December 1936, becoming one of many leftists to rally around the Republic&#39;s fight in Spain, gathering money, material, and troops to be donated for the Republican victory. By 1936, Philip&#39;s family had gained enough to move to the Bronx, joining other Jewish families in the southern part of the borough, living at 871 Kelly Street. By April 1937, he had also joined the International Longshoremen&#39;s Association.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt age 23, Philip enlisted in the 258th Field Artillery Regiment of the New York National Guard, headquartered at the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx, in March 1934. He rose to the rank of Corporal before his exit from the Guard in 1937, which makes him a relatively good soldier, as he was able to rise to the rank of Corporal relatively quickly. He served as an infantryman for his first year, before becoming an artilleryman in communications. Mandelblatt may have seen his military experience as useful to the Republic, so he eventually decided to stow away on the ship Massanet to get to Spain, joining thousands of New York City Jews who had similar experiences. Crossing the Franco-Spanish border on land in April 1938, he passed through the town of Figueres, where, like many international volunteers, he filled out a form with his personal and political information, writing that he had come to Spain to &ldquo;preserve democracy and smash fascism&rdquo;. He arrived at the frontlines at a particularly opportune moment in May 1938, as France had opened its border to the transit of Spanish arms in March 1938 and closed it again in June 1938. As a result, the Republic had been preparing their largest offensive of the war at the Battle of the Ebro, which sought to reconnect its territory and relieve the defenders of Valencia after the Nationalist advances in the Teruel offensive. Mandelblatt&#39;s experience as an artilleryman may have led him to the frontlines as part of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the Republic&#39;s initial offensive and crossing at the Ebro, especially considering the desolate state of Republican artillery. He was killed in action in the Ebro Offensive in July 1938.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Wilfred &ldquo;Mendy&rdquo; Mendelson was born on August 17th, 1915 in Brooklyn, New York. He was born to two lifelong socialists. His father was a member of the Polish Jewish Workers Socialist Bund and his mother was a member of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union.&nbsp; As a young child, he was taught about socialism, even proclaiming a hunger strike for the Irish socialist Terence MacSwiney at the age of five. Mendelson lived near Bronx Park, until his parents participated in a strike against the landlords and moved into the Amalgamated Cooperative Houses. There, Wilfred attended DeWitt Clinton and graduated in June 1931. He entered the City College of New York in the fall of 1931. Mendelson was heavily involved in political activism. He was a member of the Young Communist League, the independent Student newspaper, and the National Student League. When the principal of CCNY, Freddie Robinson, invited Italian fascists, Mendelson helped organized anti-fascist protests and was met with disciplinary action from the school. Mendelson was arrested many times at strikes and protests. Mendelson organized countless strikes and helped win union working conditions for the workers of cafeterias, Nathan&rsquo;s restaurants, and farmers. Unfortunately, Mendelson was expelled from college, and he never finished. After college, he became more heavily involved with the Communist Party, becoming the Acting-Organizational Secretary for the Communist Party of the 2nd Assembly District&mdash;his home neighborhood. After college, Mendelson was heavily invested in educating himself about communism, and when Franco&rsquo;s generals attacked Spain, it was Mendelson&rsquo;s natural cause to join the fight for the Republic. Mendelson had been deliberating on joining the war for a long time, but he was finally pushed to join the war effort after hearing Spanish veterans speak at the New York Hippodrome. He made the final decision on December 9th, 1937. After heavily studying the situation in Spain and dealing with passport and recruitment issues, Wilfred &ldquo;Mendy&rdquo; Mendelson left for Spain on the United States Liner S.S. Manhattan on May 18th, 1938. He arrived in Spain on May 29th, 1938. Mendelson came with about five other American volunteers to the Republican camp at Marsa. When he arrived, he was put into a training program. Mendelson had a tenuous grasp on Spanish, but nonetheless he helped teach the other volunteers. He also had an opportunity to stay in the rear, but he chose to fight on the front. After completing his basic training, Mendelson joined the Lincoln-Washington Battalion of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade on June 30th, 1938. The Brigade&rsquo;s objective at this point of the war was to redirect Franco&rsquo;s forces away from Valencia. On July 25, 1938, the Army of the Ebro crossed the River, and the Abraham Lincoln Brigade went with the second wave of Republican troops. The Army of the Ebro managed to capture 500 square miles of land and successfully locked down Francoist troops for four months. As the Brigade landed on the shore of Asco, Mendelson was outside the small town of Villalba de los Arcos, and this is where Wilfred suffered a fatal injury. Mendelson was sent back across the Ebro on a stretcher to the base hospital, but he died before cross the river back. He was buried in Asco, on the side of a railroad bridge next to the river. He died on July 29th, 1938, exactly two months after arriving in Spain.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Walter (William) Richter was a German-born American who participated in the Spanish Civil War as a member of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. He was born in 1903 in Ronneburg, located near the center of Germany. At some point in his life, he traveled to Bremen to embark on a voyage to New York City. On February 23, 1927, he departed from Bremen on a ship called the Stuttgart, which was bound for New York. After a journey of several days, he arrived in New York on March 5, 1927. Walter was 24 years old at the time of his arrival and was a mechanist.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1927 was part of a time when the United States was going through a period of social and economic change. The stock market in the United States was reaching new limits, and people believed that growth was endless. However, immigration to the United States was restricted due to the Immigration Act of 1924, also known as the Johnson-Reed Act. This law established quotas, limiting the number of immigrants who could come to the United States each year. Walter Richter was fortunate to come to America and take advantage of the rapid industrialization and growth that provided more job opportunities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWalter Richter settled in New York City and would live on 50 E. 13th Street in lower Manhattan. Walter would become involved in leftist politics, joining the Communist Party in 1933. 50 E. 13th Street is located in Greenwich Village. Greenwich Village was a center of leftist politics and home to many members and sympathizers of the Communist Party. During the 1930s and 1940s, communism was at the peak of its popularity. The Communist Party U.S.A would even move its headquarters to Manhattan at 35 East 12th Street. New York would become the capital city of American communism. However, during this time, America was hit with the Great Depression, which began in 1929 and lasted for over a decade. Not only did this financially ruin many Americans, but it also increased the appeal of communism to many people who were looking for a way out of their social and economic problems. Many people began to either join the Communist Party or became sympathizers. Walter Richter may have joined the Communist Party due to the hardships he faced and his willingness to fight for change.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen the Spanish Civil War broke out, Walter Richter saw his chance to fight against fascism and make his mark in history. He sailed aboard the Berengaria on January 20, 1937, and arrive in Spain on February 4, 1937, to fight for the Republicans. He would serve with the XV International Brigade, also known as the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. In the RGASPI Archives, it is stated that &ldquo;little known of him.&rdquo; Throughout the war, Walter was frequently in the hospital. Despite his time spent recovering, Walter managed to participate in the Battle of Brunete, a battle that unfolded right outside of Madrid in July 1937. The Battle of Brunete was part of the Republicans&#39; larger offensive strategy to relieve pressure on Madrid and gain an advantage. The offensive achieved little real success for the Republicans. One week later, Nationalist forces were able to recapture Brunete. The inability to make a solid breakthrough, losing valuable troops and resources, was slowly becoming a theme for the Republic. As a member of the Washington Battalion within the International Brigades, Walter Richter fought alongside volunteers from various countries. However, Walter was one of those wounded. On January 18th, 1938, Walter Richter and another volunteer, Peter Frye, were sent to Albacete for repatriation. This was due to his passport being expired on January 1938. Walter would board the Normandie as a stowaway and would reach New York once again on May 30, 1938. However, since Walter Richter&rsquo;s passport was expired, he was forced to self-deport on December 28, 1938.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 1930s were a time of great political and social upheaval. The rise of fascism, and the growing popularity of communism in the United States, would be a part of this time. Walter Richter&#39;s story provides a glimpse into the experiences of the many individuals who were caught up in these larger historical events and how they navigated through them.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Philip Cooperman was born to a Jewish family circa 1908. He was a member of the ROTC (Reserve Officers&rsquo; Training Corps) for 3 years prior to the war. He most likely did not serve in the Great War, since he would&rsquo;ve been just 6 years old at its onset, and 10 by its conclusion, meaning his military service came during the interwar period. He was a bacteriologist, and joined the communist party in 1934. He resided in 345 East 18th Street, located in Gramercy Park, which is slightly north of the Lower East Side, which was predominantly Jewish in the early 20th century, although many began to leave it in the 1920s and 1930s for other neighborhoods. Philip Cooperman was most likely part of that wave of immigration out of the Lower East Side. However, there is a distinct possibility that Cooperman was not part of the great wave of Jewish migration into the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which mostly originated in Eastern Europe, and that he was either the descendant of German Jews that immigrated earlier or that he was an immigrant himself, arriving in the U.S. after the Great War.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a communist, he probably felt inspired to travel to Spain and fight on behalf of the Spanish Republic. Furthermore, as a Jew, he most likely felt the same sentiments as many of his fellow Jewish combatants, who were eager to fight the fascist menace that had terrorized Jews across Europe. He obtained a passport (# 356256) on December 7, 1936, and sailed for Spain on the SS Normandie on December 26, 1936. He arrived in Spain on January 6, 1937, where he served with the Lincoln Battalion as a member of the 15th International Brigade, which was mostly comprised of English-speaking, North American volunteers. He was a staff officer and Battalion Secretary. Shortly after arriving in Spain, Cooperman became acquainted with Robert Merriman, who would eventually come to lead the Battalion. According to Merriman&rsquo;s diary, the two first met on February 9, 1937, most likely in the Albacete headquarters. The two had an evening walk 2 days later on the 11th. During the tumult of the Brigade&rsquo;s earliest months, Cooperman became involved in a power struggle with Marvin Stern for the post of political commissar. Eventually, the post was filled by a triumvirate consisting of Cooperman, Stern, and Bernard Walsh. Like most American volunteers, Cooperman fought in the Jarama Valley. During the battle, he was approached by Joe Gordon, who tried to get help for his injured comrades. Cooperman, however, wanted nothing to do with it, so he relayed Gordon to HQ, where Merriman, beset with problems, sent him back to Cooperman, after which he would take actions into his own hands. During the February 27, 1937 attack on Pingarr&oacute;n, which left the Abraham Lincoln Battalion heavily crippled due to the loss of many members, including several leaders, Cooperman, according to Merriman, ended up taking control of the attack after being handed commanded by David Jones, with Bob Thompson being second in command. However, there are sources that contradict Merriman&rsquo;s diary, as some claim that Cooperman took command without receiving it from Jones, and then passed it to Van den Berghe, whereas another source states that Cooperman refused command, and it was instead taken up by Cuban volunteer Arturo Corona. In Cecil D. Eby&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;Comrades and Commissars: The Lincoln Battalion in the Spanish Civil War&rdquo;, he claims that Cooperman actively refused to take command from Merriman and that he wanted no part in the fighting. Eby gives a very negative picture of Cooperman in general, painting him as a pudgy, political, secretary who only values his life, which contrasts greatly with Merriman&rsquo;s view of him. In the aftermath of Jarama, which Eby dubs a massacre, Cooperman (labelled as a &ldquo;Party yo-yo&rdquo;) served as a witness in a trial against a British lieutenant named Clifford Wattis, who was made a scapegoat for the massacre. 10 days prior to the attack on Pingarr&oacute;n, Cooperman and Merriman had met up with each other, presumably at the Battle of Jarama itself. At some point in the weeks following the battle, Robert Raven, who had been blinded and would become the war&rsquo;s most famous casualty, told the story of his harrowing experience to Cooperman.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCooperman and Merriman would reunite on April 23 at the Lincoln Brigade&rsquo;s new headquarters in the Estado Mayor in Morata after the latter arrived there late in the evening. The two then talked the following day after breakfast. Merriman pleasantly remarked at Cooperman&rsquo;s presence at the Independence Day festivities, since he helped Merriman keep the rowdy Canadians in line. Cooperman joined Merriman and the other American leaders for a meeting on August 7, after which he confided in Merriman that he wanted to go home and seek repatriation. The two had a conversation in the evening of August 12, reminiscing on the past. He worked with Sidney Shostek to audit the books of the Brigade&rsquo;s treasurer following a scandal involving the loss of hundreds of thousands of pesetas. He was killed in action at an unknown time and place, most likely after March 14, 1938, since he was in Guadalajara that day. It is possible that he deserted, explaining the lack of information concerning the time and place of death, but it has most likely been lost to the sands of time. There was another volunteer named Phillip Cooperman who boarded the SS Washington at Le Havre on November 1, 1937, nearly a year after Philip Cooperman arrived. He was born in 1910, which would&rsquo;ve made him 26 at the start of the war, which is only a little bit off from 28, and his address was listed as 365 East 18th Street, which is within 150 feet of the other Cooperman&rsquo;s address. Since Cooperman would be in Spain until at least March 1938, this is a potential case of identity fraud, where someone looking to flee Spain and/or return to the U.S. assumed this false alias.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI was unfortunately not able to locate any images or records of his education, which is surprising considering his relatively high positions within the brigade hierarchy. However, it is possible that these documents were destroyed, redacted, and/or classified, possibly as a direct consequence of his status as both Battalion Secretary and Political Commissar, although for what reason is unclear.</p>\r\n",

Pre-war, he worked as a machinist and not in a relationship. He sailed to Spain on July 9, 1937 on the Berengaria. He served as an interpreter for the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion, which was for Canadian volunteers of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Interestingly, Ocasio shows up in the book Cartas desde Elora (Letters from Elora) by Susan Komah. In it, he is shown interpreting between the new Spanish speaking recruits and the English speaking sergeant as this tiny group made their way to headquarters in Albacete. Ocasio said that after getting their info taken down and uniforms, they would be moved to Taraziba de la Mancha for training. He left on December 30, 1938 on the Ausonia. During the 1950s, Ocasio&rsquo;s name appeared on a list of people deemed to still have ties to the Soviet Union, and who would have to show up for a hearing in front of the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws. His name appeared twice because they switched his middle and last name (Garcia and Ocasio), with both names having the same address (43 East 112th Street, NYC).

        "data": "<p>Albert M. Wallach was born to Aaron Wallach and Al Morris in 1904 in the United States of America. He grew up a troublesome teenager, but was pressured into attending a College of Business for two years. After failing as a student, he became a US Army Reserve Officer and spent his time with his friends. Many of these friends were Spanish Republic sympathizers, and believers in communism. Pressured by them to join up and sail to Spain, he agreed, reluctantly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWallach received Passport #377964 which listed his address as 226 West 79th Street, NYC, before March 5, 1937, when he set out for Spain when. Regrettably, he experienced a hernia on board and needed immediate surgery in Paris. Wallach&#39;s companions took him from bed and concealed him at their hotel so they wouldn&#39;t have to pay the hospital fee. The heist put the movement of additional volunteers to Spain in grave jeopardy, especially when French authorities issued a warrant for Wallach&#39;s arrest. He claimed to require more medical care, but the Americans in charge of the volunteers believed him to be faking it and sent him to Spain. On May 30, 1937, Albert arrived in Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt turned out to be a poor choice. Wallach requested a safe position after receiving criticism for spreading stories during training. Wallace dodged the fight despite being denied that exit. Wallach had first deserted at Brunete and then, after being brought back, had again gone at Quinto, according to Captain Hans Amlie, who called him &quot;my smart Jew deserter,&quot; perhaps a joke, perhaps not. There were many Jews serving in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, but evidence of any apparent anti-semetism was not present.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWallach was next observed during the retreats serving at the front in a labor battalion after returning to the Lincolns for a third time following Teruel. Voros believed that Wallach had been slain in the subsequent battle, however it appears that Wallach took advantage of the military breakdown to once more desert. He was detained at the Brigade jail at Castillo de Fellas with a prisoner called Edward Horan (also known as Palega), who remembers Wallach&#39;s assertion that he was employed by both the anarchist party and the American consul in Barcelona. Wallach was apprehended while wearing civilian clothing throughout Barcelona. He also remembered that Wallach was led from his cell around May 1, a month after the retreats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the end of the war, when Wallach had not returned to the country, his father looked into the matter personally. He socialized with some of the Lincoln veterans in New York while dressed as a sailor. Horan told him that an American working for the Spanish military intelligence (SIM) had purposely killed his son after he had been brutally beaten and starved over quite a period and hauled out to the courtyard without a court martial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nCommissar Gates would only corroborate his knowledge of Wallach&#39;s death in Spain when confronted with this account. Anthony DeMaio, a volunteer for Lincoln, was charged with a felony by the older Wallach in testimony to the Dies committee. DeMaio vehemently denied knowing about any deaths at Castillo de Fells fifty years later. Horan, a deserter and anti-Communist undercover agent for the Chicago police, served as the primary informant in this case. Later, he repeated the accusations in front of the Subversive Activities Control Board of the United States government. Horan&#39;s truthfulness cannot be confirmed or refuted.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Sol Newman was born on August 15th, 1908. He grew up in Washington Heights, New York, the youngest of five surviving children in a large Jewish family. Early on Newman developed a passionate love of baseball, the Brooklyn Dodgers in particular, and the English language. He wrote plays, poems, and novels all his life and was a gifted storyteller. Newman earned a Bachelor&rsquo;s and Master&rsquo;s degree from Southern Connecticut State College. It was this experience - getting an education surrounded by like-minded socialists and Marxists - that influenced his move back to New York to work as a Taxi Driver and help run the local Transport Workers Union and American Federation of Labor offices. At the same time, Newman had also become a card-carrying member of the Communist Party of the USA where he worked in the agitation and propaganda unit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After hearing news of the Spanish coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat by nationalist forces from friends and co-workers, Newman resolved to go to Spain and sailed aboard the French Line ship SS Ile de France to France on February 20th, 1937. In France, Newman spent a week in Paris pretending to be a tourist, before trekking over the French-Spanish border into Spain, so that he could enlist with the 1st Regiment de Tren, 2nd Squadron. This specific squadron was a unit of truck drivers, transporting Spanish and International fighters to the front.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In letters back home, Newman described his time in Spain as a mixture of relaxation and heavy, fatiguing work. Newman recalls his first week staying in an ex Duke&rsquo;s former villa in Catalonia. There Newman and his fellow squad members threw lavish parties. Right after however, Newman described driving for 50 hours straight in preparation for the battle of Brunete. Newman spent the war transporting troops to and from Brunete, as well as Aragon and Madrid. It was at Brunete where Newman was pictured with some of his squad members and the famous poet and writer Langston Hughes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When not driving or fighting, Newman spent his free time editing a paper for the members of his unit and also wrote poems and stories for various newspapers throughout the US. Newman even got one of his stories, titled Smudge on a Chinese Rug, published in Esquire Magazine while still fighting in Spain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newman went back home in October of 1938 aboard the SS Paris for his father&rsquo;s funeral and proceeded to stay in the United States. He got his old job as a taxi organizer for the Transport Workers Union in New York, and it was here, at a taxi strike in the Spring of 1940, that Newman met his future wife Edie. Once they got married the Newmans moved to New Haven, where Sol got a job working at the Yale University Press, and the New Haven Courier. It was here that Newman was investigated by the US Government for ties to Communism, and actively protested the Mccarthy trials, as well as the arrests of Ethel and Julian Rosenberg. Sol continued to be an ardent supporter of the Lincoln Brigade and its veterans, and a passionate socialist, who was even investigated by the government for his ties to the CPUSA. After a long life in New Haven, Sol and his wife Edie moved to the Meriter Retirement Home in Madison, Wisconsin, where he died on March 9th, 1999, at the age of 90. He is survived by three children, three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren, and even asked that donations be made in his name to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>&quot;A soldier who is politically conscious that he is right and who has a feeling of community with his society...will do his job well&quot; -Bill Aalto<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWilliam Oliver Aalto (preferred to be called Bill) was born in the Bronx on July 30th, 1915. His mother, Elsa Johanna Akkola, was a militant member of the Finnish Communist Party who fled to the United States due to her political beliefs and enrolled in the local communist party. Bright and well-educated from a once prominent landowning family, Elsa had immigrated to New York. Throughout her hard years of domestic service as a single mother in the stratified social hierarchy of America, she retained her staunch beliefs, gravitating towards local communist groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn 1927, Elsa married fellow Finnish immigrant Otto Aalto, the latter becoming the stepfather of 12-year old Bill. While he went through school, Bill took after his mother&#39;s social conscience; running with the Harlem Proletarians (a Finnish youth club) and joining the Bronx Young Communist League. Searching for his moment to make a difference in the world, Bill was struck by a personal tragedy- the death of his half-brother, Henry. In 1935, Bill, aged 18, left home and school, working as a truck driver before deciding to go to Spain and join the International Brigades(IB).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBill (aged 21) arrived in Spain in February 1937, a son of immigrants determined to make his mark upon an unforgiving world. At the time, Soviet military advisors in Spain were putting together their own guerrilla units within the IBs due to a lack of Spanish manpower. Being 6&#39;2 and having studied Spanish before, Bill was immediately recruited as a guerrilla soldier at Albacete, fighting in the Republican irregular forces. He repeatedly volunteered for dangerous operations, often spending weeks behind enemy lines. &quot;I became a guerrilla and stalked,&quot; said Bill in a 1942 interview, &quot;saw no bayonets, met very little machine gun fire, cut the barbed wire.&quot; Trained by Soviet instructors in the use of pressure-sensitive explosives, Bill, along with fellow comrades-in-arms Alex Kunstlich and Irving Goff, Bill worked with a detachment of Spanish guerrillas destroying railroad tracks, bridges, and power lines in preparation of the Republican offensive that began the Battle of Teruel. Their objective to destroy the main supply bridge over the Albarracin River may have been the inspiration for Ernest Hemingway&#39;s novel For Whom the Bell Tolls (though Bill himself was not present during that operation). By late 1937, both Spanish and International irregular forces were brought together as the Fourteenth Corps of the Republican army.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAs the battle for Teruel raged onward with no end in sight, guerrilla operations on the Southern front were greatly amplified. Alex Kunstlich came to command his own unit, with Bill as his second in command. Bill was responsible for all the logistics, supply, and strategic planning of Kunstlich&#39;s operations, in addition to driving the truck taking groups to their rendezvous points. The vast majority of their work remained that of demolitions - as very few guerrilla groups had the supplies to engage in partisan operations. This reflected the Republic&#39;s military weakness as a whole: so crippled by non-intervention it could barely equip its own troops - let alone distribute arms to the peasantry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nDuring the great retreats of 1938, Kunstlich was captured and executed near Granada. Nationalist armies had charged through Aragon to the sea, splitting the Republic in two. To restore morale in the face of this catastrophe, authorities planned a daring action in which both Bill and Irving Goff would undertake. On May 20th, Bill, now a lieutenant, alongside Goff, led a team of 25 guerrillas in a successful amphibious raid at Carchuna, Motril on the Southern coast of Spain, rescuing 300 Republican prisoners. They reportedly cut communication lines, killed the prison guards, and armed the prisoners with hand grenades. &quot;We weren&#39;t a raiding party,&quot; Goff boasted, &quot;We were a battalion&quot;. While the prisoners raced towards Republican lines, the rear guard, consisting of Goff, Bill, and two Spaniards, leaped from the cliff into the Mediterranean. Though both Spaniards drowned, Goff and Aalto used the cover of darkness to reach the shore at the edge of the cliffside, under the enemy camp. Trapped by the presence of enemy scouts, they reportedly huddled in the shallow waters for 48 hours, starving, thirsty, cold, and exhausted. In desperation, they swam to a nearby cave and rested for a day. Finally, they moved to a farmhouse, where they received the hospitality of Spanish peasants before returning to their base. This was the only commando raid ever undertaken in Spanish history.<br />\r\nIn June 1938, Bill was promoted to captain after 17 months of service, later spending three long periods hospitalized with fever, colitis, and chronic malaria. With the war essentially lost, Bill repeatedly wrote to his superiors that they&#39;d all be better off returning to the states and supporting the Republic on the publicity front. He was also concerned his passport might expire - he was still financially responsible towards his mother and half-brother John. It was November when he arrived in a demobilization unit in Valencia, January 1939 when he arrived in Barcelona, and February when he sailed to New York. He had been in Spain for nearly two years.<br />\r\nThough Bill came out of the war with the highest commendations, he did not tell his war stories. He was torn between the justice of the cause and the inhumane violence war demanded. &quot;The war is breaking us,&quot; he wrote, &quot;but also remaking us&quot;. Nevertheless he remained an active member of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB), speaking on behalf of the Republican cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOn January 20, 1939, Bill&#39;s stepfather, Otto Aalto, who had recently separated from his mother, denounced Bill to the FBI, reporting that as a partisan leader of the returning Lincolns, his stepson constituted a danger to the United States. As the Lincolns were already under FBI scrutiny, Bill was recommended for custodial detention. The detention was canceled a few months later when Bill volunteered for the army, as the authorities had decided military service was an alternative mode of surveillance for the Lincoln vets. However, Bill found himself assigned only to most menial tasks. &quot;I&#39;m on the FBI shit list,&quot; he said to a fellow Lincoln, &quot;or else the army&#39;s blacklist&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn 1941, Bill&#39;s former comrade-in-arms, Irving Goff, recommended him for recruitment to the Office of Strategic Services - a force that could utilize the Lincolns&#39; guerrilla experience in conjunction with resistance movements in the partisan war within Europe. However, he was not able to join.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nShortly after returning from Spain, Bill had confided his homosexuality to Goff, who revealed it to the other Lincolns, many of which felt Bill&#39;s sexual orientation could be pose risk to them all. It made them an easy target - not for the clutches of the FBI, but rather for slander by the public and within the army. At the collective request of the veterans&#39;, Bill was transferred to a training camp in Maryland in 1942, where he trained officer recruits in sabotage and demolition. In September 1943, Bill saw an officer drop a live hand grenade and lunged for it. Before he could throw it away, the grenade exploded, blowing off his right hand and part of his forearm. Bill was invalided out of service with a disability pension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nWith the help of his pension and the G.I. Bill, he returned to further his education, studying poetry at Columbia University. At this time, he published several pieces of his writings in the New Masses. After the OSS incident, Bill drifted away from contact with the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBill later traveled to Europe, where he met the poet W.H. Auden. Though sharing the company of other poets, Bill wrote little and gravitated towards alcoholism, frequently entering violent periods. Toward the end of his life, he became the lover of poet James Schuyler&#39;s, and features in Schuyler&#39;s poem, Dining Out with Doug and Frank.</p>\r\n",

Neugass began writing poetry early on in his life and left at a young age to become a writer in New York City. &quot;I have been writing poetry since I was seventeen,&quot; he said in 1933, &quot;lots of it and nothing but it.&quot; Since then, Neugass has attended prestigious universities like Yale, Harvard, and Oxford, where he learned everything from mining engineering to fine arts to history. In the 1920s, he spent most of his time traveling around Europe until he returned to the United States in 1932, where he pursued writing while working in different professions such as book reviewer, janitor, social worker, and fencing coach.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNeugass was also closely connected with the Communist Party for most of the 1930s and 1940s. He worked as an editor of a union paper published by the Office Workers Union, an organization led by communists and was even arrested for participating in events supporting Ohrbach workers&rsquo; strike. Neugass then helped to establish the State, County and Municipal Workers of America, which was an American labor union representing state, county, and local government employees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn mid-November 1937, the then 32-year-old James Neugass left his home in Queens, New York and boarded the Queen Mary to join the nearly 3000 American volunteers that formed the two American battalions (the Lincoln Battalion and the Washington Battalion) that later became known collectively as the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Many of the volunteers in the Brigades had passports that were marked &ldquo;not valid for travel in Spain&rdquo; so to participate in the fight in Spain, they had to trek over the Pyrenees mountains in France. James, however, had volunteered as a medical worker and had direct entry into Spain. He was assigned to be an ambulance driver in the American Medical Bureau, founded by Edward Barsky. Under the leadership of Barsky, the American Medical Bureau established hospitals in churches and monasteries, and formed a mobile medical unit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen questioned by the Daily Worker, a newspaper published by the Communist Party in the United States, pertaining to the reasons why he went to Spain to join the Lincoln Brigade, Neugass answered humorously, &ldquo;First of all, I was spending too much money each day buying newspapers to read about the Spanish situation. Secondly, I went there to get some sleep&hellip;New York City is such a noisy place&rdquo; (Wald). Neugass no doubt felt the need to respond to the call for the defense of the Spanish Republic as the rise of fascism in Europe demanded immediate action from socialist activists across the globe. &ldquo;The entire country is organized to strengthen the thin thousand mile dam of dugouts, men and munitions which separate not only the Republic but every democratic nation on earth, from fascism,&rdquo; he wrote (Kaufman). Neugass feared that if the Spanish Republic were to fall, then the rest of the world would also fall to fascism.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA month after Neugass arrived in Spain, he was present at the Battle of Teruel, one of the bloodiest conflicts in the Spanish Civil War, with over 100,000 atrocities. Neugass drove an ambulance back and forth in dangerous fighting zones, personally assisted in setting up hospital units, and endured a number of shrapnel wounds throughout the terrible attacks and counter-attacks. James had to drive the ambulance without lights on out of fear of being bombarded by Mussolini or Hitler&rsquo;s armies. During The Aragon Offensive (the &ldquo;Great Retreats&rdquo;), which was shortly after the Battle of Teruel, when Republican defenses began to crumble, Neugass was forced to engage in hand-to-hand combat for survival. After a tough escape in which he brought Dr. Edward Barsky and other persons to safety, Neugass was instructed to return home with a letter of particular recognition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUpon returning to the US on April 14, 1938, aboard the Ile de France, Neugass typed up War is Beautiful, a memoir that accounts Neugass&rsquo;s experiences in the war including the atrocities of the war and the days spent darting onto battlefields to carry the injured and the dead away He married Myra Chavelle, with whom he had two sons, on September 30, 1940 in NYC, while working on a long poem about Spain and a couple of shorter ones. In the 1940s, he worked as a cabinet maker and foreman in a machine shop while concluding Rain of Ashes, a novel based on a wealthy New Orleans family that closely resembled his own and the novel was published in 1949. This was the same year Neugass died of a heart attack at the age of 44 in Greenwich Village on September 7. Half a century later in 2000, a bookdealer found Neugass&rsquo;s manuscript in a Vermont bookstore that was believed to have come from the collection of Max Eastman, once a famous revolutionary writer who died in 1969. The five hundred pages long manuscript ended up in the hands of Neugass&rsquo;s son Paul and then to Peter Carroll and Peter Glazer, historians of American involvement in the Spanish Civil War. The two edited the unfinished manuscript and War is Beautiful: An American Ambulance Driver in the Spanish Civil War was published in 2008.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Milton Young was born in the Bronx, New York. Once he completed his schooling at Penn State University, and returned to New York in search of a job. Despite his qualifications and good education, Milton&#39;s search for a private job was fruitless, so he took a job in the WPA Teachers Union in New York City.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilton had begun feeling strongly about the protection of security and workers&rsquo; rights. As he participated in strikes and picket lines, he became frustrated with the capitalist system. Once the United States Congress voted to prohibit citizens from selling arms to the democratically elected Republic in Spain, Milton, as a member of the Youth Communist League, left to fight for the Republic. He was one of the thousand Jewish Americans that joined the International Brigades in the fight against Fascism.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnfortunately, there is little information about Milton during the war. His name is not listed on the Scope of Soviet Activities list, so it is likely he used false travel documents under a different name to arrive in Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn June, 1937, Milton was placed in charge of the Runners. The George Washington Battalion was reserved at Morata de Tajuna after fighting from the line at Jarama. On June 30th, the Battalion left to join the 15th Brigade at Brunete.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrior to the start of the offensive at Brunete, the previous Commander Hourihan was transferred and replaced as Acting commander of the Lincoln Brigade by Oliver Law.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt 2:00 A.M on July 6th, the Licoln Brigade left its camp by the Aulencia River until it overlooked the Guadarrama plain over a ridge at 5:30 A.M. It was to act as reserve as the British Battalion launched the first offensive, attempting to cut off the retreat of Nationalist forces. However, this operation failed, as the British Battalion drew heavy fire. The Americans were sent in to relieve the pressure. Due to high casualties, and scorching heat, the offensive was put on halt until the next day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOvernight, the 13th Brigade and the Spanish Assault regiment carried out an airplane bombardment of the town. On July 7th, the Lincoln Brigade made advancements to the Guadarrama River. However, by July 9th, the Fascists were able to set up mosquito nests and trenches along Mosquito Ridge, causing the deaths of countless soldiers and officers, including Commander Oliver Law.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was in the beginning of the Battle of Brunete that Milton died, just a few months after arriving in Spain. The date of Milton Young&rsquo;s death is disputed; most sources claim he either died on July 7th or 10th. Because Milton was shot by a Fascist machine gun, it is likely he died on July 10th on Mosquito Ridge.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>John Hagilaous (also known as Hatzilaou, Hadjigeorgiou, Hageleou, or Hadjilahus) was born on August 4, 1902, on the tiny Greek island of Kalymnos. His mother, Katrina Hagilaou, and his father, James Hagilaou lived a relatively simple life of agriculture in their village. Because of Kalymnos&rsquo; rural nature, education was limited on the island, with many children not able to attend school. Even so, many families made significant sacrifices to send their kids to school because they valued education. John was fortunate enough to attend elementary school. Eventually though, he ended up deciding to emigrate to the United States to seek out better opportunities and a chance to explore the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArriving in the United States, he joined the Marine Corps. John underwent arduous training regimens throughout the course of those five years, becoming more resilient physically as well as mentally. In time, he attained the rank of Corporal. His role required leadership, dependability, and communication to effectively mentor and guide the junior Marines. During his stay in the US, John worked for The Works Progress Administration (WPA) which employed him to carry out public work projects. Living in the busy streets of Manhattan on 7th avenue, it was easy to take on various jobs such as printing, painting, and carpentry to earn money.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJohn also affiliated himself with the Communist Party, and joined several organizations that supported the left&rsquo;s cause. For instance, the Spartacus Club helped organize the working class people so that they could promote the cause of socialism. They supported labor rights, civil rights, and anti-facism. He also joined the Ex-Servicemen&#39;s League that provided a voice for the American veterans. John also sought to be educated and hear the voices of other Greek immigrants, therefore he joined the Greek Worker&rsquo;s Education Club and indulged in community classes on language, civics, and labor rights. It was there when he learned of the Spanish Civil War. Deeply moved by the cause, John volunteered to fight for the International Brigades.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn December 26, 1936, he sailed aboard the Ile de France. On January 3rd, 1937 he arrived in Spain. Three days later, he enrolled for the Brigades. By this time, he was 37 years old. Although he didn&rsquo;t fight in a physical sense, John still played an important role as a medic and mess sergeant for the army. During the Lincoln Battalion (17th battalion of the XV Brigade), he served in Co.2, Section 2, Group 3, as a Sanidad (which in Spanish translates to &ldquo;medical&rdquo;) that provides health support and combat casualty care to the wounded. Later, he would take on the role of the Mess Sergeant which was responsible for the food supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nEventually, John would also serve in a unit for the Washington Battalion, as both the Lincons and the Washington Battalions suffered heavy losses of men. This time putting his training from the Marines to use, he became a military staff, or in Spanish you would call it &ldquo;Estado Mayor.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn February 1937, John fought in the battle of Jarama River. Because Franco&rsquo;s troops were struggling to break through Madrid&rsquo;s western troops under the slogan &ldquo;No Pasaran,&rdquo; his soldiers equipped with the latest weaponry aided by Hitler and Mousolini launched an attack to the south east of the city. Franco&rsquo;s goal was to cut off the main road between Madrid and Valencia, which was a highway that provided the necessary food and fuel to the city from the Metterarian port. Despite the International Brigades and British Battilion&rsquo;s lack of training and equipment, they fought bravely but suffered heavy casualties. John was busily aiding soldiers as a medic during this time, healing the countless wounded fighters. Eventually they were forced to retreat into headquarters, but still continued to resist Franco&rsquo;s troops with machine guns. On the second day, some volunteers. And on the third day, the battalion&rsquo;s defense broke from the constant bombardment of artillery and tank attacks. At the end, the remaining 140 exhausted volunteers regrouped and successfully recaptured their positions. Because of the time the soldiers bought, the line was reinforced and drew out a stalemate that lasted for the rest of the war.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLater in July of that year, John fought in the Battle of Brunete led by Fred Copeman on the offensive to capture the heavily defended village of Villanueva de la Canada. The idea was to break through the Nationalist&rsquo;s forces at their weakest point. Though they succeeded in capturing Brunete and a few other villages, they were fatigued with thirst by the scorching temperature of upward of a hundred degrees fahrenheit and the relentless airstrikes. Ultimately, they were unable to progress so they eventually retreated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, despite his heroic leadership and bravery, around January 22, 1938, Hagilaou was placed under arrest and imprisoned, likely by his fellow volunteers, who reported his comments to the Brigade. He criticized the Communist Party for allegedly utilizing money raised in America to pay for luxurious party members&#39; purchases instead of aiding the war effort. &ldquo;All the money, which the Communist Party collects in the United States in order to buy cigarettes and other presents for the comrades in Spain is being spent by the members of the Party in eating steaks in the Fifth Avenue. If you return to the United States, go also to the 32nd Street and to the 13th Street and tell them ...&rdquo; and &ldquo;You will be dishonourable persons if you will not tell them this, which I have said.&rdquo;Hagilaou urged other volunteers to spread the message that the party was misusing funds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the war, John settled back to Greece where he visited his cousins Filippos and Nikos.</p>\r\n",

Her address was listed as 1184 Cornwell Ave. From New York City, she sailed to Spain on the Normandie (April 14, 1937) and arrived on May 10 alongside the American Medical Bureau to serve as a nurse. She was posted throughout Spain, in Belalcazar, Vich, and Cordoba. During her time on the Cordoba front, she suffered from an unspecified mental illness but was barred from returning home by Dr. Barsky (a top surgeon). Friends recall her peculiar behavior; she kept an extra washcloth for the &ldquo;possible&rdquo; and excessively washed her undergarments as an excuse to hang them to dry: an open invitation to get shot by a Nationalist. The strenuous circumstances (sweltering weather and poor conditions) likely exacerbated Hershkowitz&rsquo;s mental illness. It is unknown why she sailed to Spain at all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHershkowitz&rsquo;s biography is brief, as she did not desire to live to tell it. After returning to the States on June 14, 1938 on the Aquitania (just past a year in Spain), Hershkowitz attempted suicide multiple times. She strangled herself at Beth Israel Medical Center, as well as attempted to drown herself. A man who loved her, Morris Kornblum, assisted Hershkowitz&rsquo;s mother with her hospital care. Kornblum (later changing his name to Martin Balter) served in Spain too, as a lab technician and field medic. His admiration did not ultimately deter her from ending her own life. She killed herself on August 1st, six weeks back home, dying at 27. (A separate record in &ldquo;Medicine in Republican Exile&rdquo; by Francisco Guerra, however, states that she was instead repatriated at the end of the war and simply &ldquo;died&rdquo; in 1968.) Hershkowitz was not survived by a partner nor children.</p>\r\n",

Hadley enlisted in the Navy and served for four years (1924-1928) before being discharged.

He lodged with other members of the union, often sharing meals with Ann Rivington, a columnist for The Daily Worker. It was through his friendship with Rivington that Hadley was introduced to communist ideas, eventually becoming an avid student of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Rivington made concrete the communist struggle; to her, it was linked to the Spanish Civil War, a war she had already seen friends go abroad to fight for. She and Hadley discussed the capitalist forces they saw shaping the dynamics of the war: on the one hand, the wealthy and powerful, Franco&rsquo;s Army, fascist Italy, and fascist Germany, and on the other, the people&rsquo;s army, the Republic. Meanwhile, Hadley had yet to find success publishing his work. He sold his car to stay in New York a bit longer, wanting to see his career come to fruition, or perhaps already drawn in by the idea of serving in Spain. After attending a speech about the war, Hadley felt certain he had found his calling. Rivington described a dramatic change in his demeanor; a renewed sense of purpose made his last few weeks in New York some of his happiest. Before he left, Hadley instructed Rivington to write a letter to his daughter, to be sent if he died in Spain. The letter, later published in the Daily Worker, clearly outlines the series of events that radically changed William Grant Hadley&rsquo;s perspective on his own life, purpose, and politics, and drove him to enlist in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHadley set sail to France aboard the Aquitania on April 28, 1937. He made it to Marseille safely, continuing his correspondence with Ann Rivington, his letters uplifting and hopeful. Hadley was one of around 250 International Brigade volunteers aboard the ship the City of Barcelona to get from France to Spain. Though the neighbors were ostensibly allies against fascism, the French government, under pressure from Western allies, refused to send most forms of aid that the Republic requested, and the land border between the two countries was sealed. Thus, the volunteers set off by sea, told to spend as much time below deck as possible. France was cracking down on illicit activity, including traveling between the two countries that violated the world&rsquo;s neutrality agreement, even as Germans and Italians openly sent supplies to Franco&rsquo;s forces. The City of Barcelona had spent one day at sea, all lights off, carefully trying to avoid Italian warships in the water as they sailed over parts of the sea that the Non-Interventionist Committee deemed Italian waters. The volunteers began to connect, socializing in common languages, and singing. It was eerie to be on a ship so dark, but their excitement for the cause brought them together.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn May 30th, the Italian submarine General Sanjuro spotted the ship about 60 kilometers away from Barcelona. They wanted revenge for a German ship that was hit a few weeks earlier. Two torpedoes were aimed at the ship, one missing, the other making contact, hitting the engine room of the boat. Many International Brigade members and crew members were below deck, near the engine room. After the torpedo made contact, nearly all of those people lost their lives. Hadley was one of them, with no chance to escape due to sheer misfortune. Many of those above deck or away from the engine room were able to board lifeboats. Jack Freeman, a survivor of the event, remembers seeing one man who couldn&rsquo;t swim remaining on the bow of the ship as it went down. He recalls hearing the singing of International Brigade members, including, perhaps, Hadley, who, in their final moments, as they sank with the ship, sang the Internationale. Blood colored the water around them. People gathered around lifeboats, cutting away at the ropes that tied them to the boat as quickly as they could. People began to jump, trying to swim away before they were unable to get away from the boat&rsquo;s pull. Many returned to save their comrades. Survivors made a slow swim to shore, where they were greeted by volunteers with supplies. Those who were gone were just that, simply gone. Many countries forbade people from fighting in Spain, including the US, leaving many of the volunteers who drowned unknown and unnamed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe wreck remains just thirty meters below sea level, a sight often visited by divers. The Italian torpedo attack on the City of Barcelona killed around 65 international brigade members; William Grant Hadley is one of twenty five known names. Taking into account regular passengers and crew members, the estimated death toll of the sinking of the City of Barcelona is upwards of 200. Hadley was killed at age 28, before he got a chance to reach Spain, and before he was able to fight for a cause he so evidently felt connected to.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Albino Zattoni (1912-1983) was born June 4th 1912 in the small town of Tres in Trentino, an Italian speaking province which was controlled by the Austro-Hungarian Empire until it&#39;s annexation by Italy in 1919. He was probably born to a working class family. His father was David Zattoni, an electrician. Albino Zattoni&rsquo;s left-wing politics and socialist values were likely instilled in him from a young age, as his father was involved with the Socialist Party of Italy. The years of his youth were a time of conflict and political upheaval in Italy as socialists and communists fought in the streets of Italian cities and towns against Mussolini&rsquo;s fascist blackshirts. In 1922, Mussolini came to power in Italy and by 1926 the Socialist Party was banned. Mussolini&rsquo;s assassinations and persecution of Italian socialists which Zattoni and his father would have experienced must have contributed to his strong anti-fascist convictions. In 1929 Zattoni made arrangements to immigrate to the United States, either searching for economic opportunity or political freedom. He arrived in New York City in 1929 at the age of 17 to begin his new life in America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zattoni arrived in New York on the tail end of a wave of massive Italian migration to the US, fueled by Italy&rsquo;s severe rural poverty. He was taken in as a boarder by the Pozza family, a family of two Italian immigrants and their four children who all had crossed the Atlantic to America in the preceding years. He lived for this time on 249 Irving Avenue in Brooklyn, and learned English. Zattoni soon became tied up again in leftist politics. He joined the Socialist Party of the United States and became an organizer for the party . In a short time, he worked his way up to becoming a leader of a local section in the Socialist Party&rsquo;s Italian Federation (the Italian American division of the party), showing once more his commitment to working class politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1936, the Spanish Civil War broke out. Zattoni presumably supported the Republic from the beginning thanks to his anti-fascist beliefs, but he was a late arriver to actually join the International Brigades. He made the decision to travel to Spain only after the brigades had been organized and the stories of international and American heroics at Madrid and Jarama had been publicized. Having been inspired to action, he got his passport on April 3rd, 1937 and set off for Spain on May 12, intending to travel to France and cross the Spanish border. However, both the US government and France adhered to non-intervention, and sought to stop volunteers from joining the Republicans. Zattoni was arrested by French authorities in May and spent a month in a French jail. On his release, he set off right away for Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zattoni arrived in Spain via Massanet on June 14th, 1937. Despite coming from the United States he chose to sign up with the XII brigade, more specifically with the Garibaldi Battalion of volunteers from Italy, along with around 100 other Italian Americans. This might reflect that he continued to identify more as Italian even after moving to America. Italian volunteers like Zattoni were in a tough position because Mussolini&rsquo;s fascist government sent tens of thousands of soldiers to Spain to fight on the nationalist side. This left Italian volunteers fighting on the opposite side to thousands of their people, while their actions made them criminals in their native country. Zattoni himself was wanted criminally by the Italian police.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zattoni arrived with the XII brigade just in time to join in their retreat from Brunete. Following this the XII brigade, as part of the 45th division, participated in the Republic&rsquo;s Zaragoza offensive, the same battle as the XV brigade&rsquo;s failed attack on Fuentes del Ebro. The offensive made some progress but failed its objectives with heavy losses for the Republicans, and the 45th was stopped just 6 km from Zaragoza. At some point, Zattoni learned Spanish as part of his time serving with the Republic. In early 1938, Zattoni&rsquo;s division was moved briefly to Extremadura, before being rushed back to Aragon to stop the Nationalist breakthrough in the crushing Aragon offensive. The Republicans suffered a great defeat, but members of the International Brigade managed to hold the Nationalists back for some time at Caspe. Zattoni fought hard at Caspe and was decorated for his service there. Despite their losses, the XII brigade (and the other brigades of the 45th) managed to rearm to participate in the massive Ebro offensive in summer 1938, during which the Republicans launched their biggest attack yet against the Nationalists. The men of the Garibaldi brigade and the rest of the 45th saw their heaviest fighting of the war, but the offensive ended in complete disaster and the destruction of the Republican army as an effective fighting force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On September 21, 1938, the International Brigades were disbanded. Zattoni and the other volunteers began shipping home. He had fought hard for his beliefs and for Spanish socialism, but as he began the return journey to New York City on December 20th aboard the Ausonia, it was already clear that the Republic was on the brink of defeat. Still, most volunteers could see that the war in Spain was just the first contest in what would become a worldwide struggle against fascism. Like so many other International Brigade volunteers, Zattoni would soon return to war. He enlisted in the US army on February 22nd, 1944 to fight the fascists again. It&#39;s not clear where he fought, but survived the war and returned to New York again by 1945/46. After his fight in WWII, Zattoni slips from the historical records. It can be assumed that he became prosperous enough to enter the middle class. He made enough money to move to Lindenhurst in Long Island, where he lived until his death in April 1983. When he died, Albino Zattoni was 71 years old and he had devoted his entire youth to the socialist cause, for which he fought in Italy, the United States, Spain, and the battlefields of WWII.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Kenneth Waldron Doolittle was born on March 10, 1903, in Schenectady, New York. He was single at the time and a seaman. He sailed on the Berengaria and arrived in Spain on September 21, 1937. During the war, he was injured twice and also reported missing in action once. He then returned to the United States on December 31, 1938, and died in January 1978.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doolittle was described to be &quot;arch and dismissive&quot;. He was also known to be a communist. His ideals attracted attention from the FBI and he was later blacklisted due to his suspicious actions, such as his CPUSA membership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kenneth Waldron Doolittle&#39;s father, Van Ness Doolittle, died when Kenneth was only four or five years old. Van Ness was an orphan who came from a background of English religious dissidents who settled in America during the 1600s. His father was an elementary school teacher and a letter carrier. After his father&#39;s death, his mother, Anna, put Kenneth into the Troy Male Catholic Orphanage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anna had to work harder to care for those around her and so she started picking hops, which are green flower-shaped plants, in the fields, which was not seen as a respectable job for women. Kenneth helped with the farming, such as the times he worked on his uncle Clarence&rsquo;s farm. Anna decided to remarry William Bryant, an African-American chef who she met during a job. He asked that Kenneth come back to his home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doolittle had a sister and two half-brothers. However, he was closest to his step-dad who he called &ldquo;Pop&rdquo;. They, unfortunately, had to move a lot, causing Doolittle to only finish school up to the sixth grade. When he was 14, Anna passed away from the Spanish flu during the time of the epidemic. He then went to sea at age 16 when a problem occurred on his uncle&rsquo;s farm. During his trip, he was exposed to Marxism. A shipmate had given him a copy of Das Kapital, written by Karl Marx. This would lead Doolittle to become a lifetime social activist. He found his wife Mary while unionizing a New York shoe factory. He organized the 119 Hospital Workers Union with her and two friends, Endicott and Johnson, and then became a delegate there as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doolittle was very anti-fascist. So, he obviously joined the fight in Spain during the Civil War. He served in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and was one of the few to return to America. He was behind fascist lines for ten days. During his time there, he was wounded during the Gandesa retreat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Battle of Gandesa took place in 1938. After winning in Caspe, the Nationalists made their way towards Catalonia, reaching Gandesa. The XV International Brigade was holding down Gandeasa when the Nationalists attacked. They put up a fight of three days, but it eventually fell to the Nationalists. Although being defeated, the battle gave time for the XV Brigade time to regroup and gather supplies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He then made it across the Ebro River by floating on a raft he made out of reeds. He was later admitted to a hospital in Barcelona, where he was infected and had an allergic reaction to horse serum, causing him to stay at the hospital longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Years pass, and Doolittle still kept in touch with the veterans he had fought with. One habit his daughters recall him doing was singing, which they said he had a great voice for, the song &quot;Viva la Quince Brigada&quot;, especially the chorus which went &quot;Rumbala, rumbala, rumbala!&quot;. They also recall him storing artifacts and documents from his past in a box.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Bernard Abramofsky was born Leonard Aibel on April 21,1914 to parents Isadore and Ida Aibel in Brooklyn, New York. Born into a Jewish family, Abramofsky&rsquo;s parents likely came to the United States via a boat to Ellis Island. Abramofsky grew up in Brooklyn and lived the entirety of his early life in the city.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbramofsky joined the military early on in life, having been a member of the US military reserves for 3 years after graduating college, and then serving abroad in the Army of the Philippines. However, he never experienced actual fighting during his time in the US military.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom his early adulthood, Abramofsky associated strongly with Communism. Having joined the Young Communist League in 1934, he would later become a card-carrying member of the Communist Party of America in 1936. Abramofsky was especially involved with the International Workers Order (IWO). As a youth member of the Order, he formed a theatrical group known as the &ldquo;Convulsionaries&rdquo;, along with his cousin Harold Melofsky as well as his friends Vaughn Love and Ernie Arion. The Convulsionaries wrote and performed songs in both Yiddish and English along with skits which depicted and parodied the situation in Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaving heard about the war in Spain, he decided that he wanted to fight for the anti-fascist cause abroad. On February 11th, 1937, Abramofsky received his passport, and 9 days later, he boarded the Ile de France. He, along with many of his comrades, went to France, and then made the trek across the Pyrenees Mountains to enter Spain. Abramofsky made the journey from New York to Spain along with his comrades in the Convulsionaries, who performed their songs and skits for the villagers and his fellow soldiers. Abramofsky was assigned to a machine-gun company along with Melofsky, and he described a burning desire to fight on the front lines.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbramofsky&rsquo;s prior military training experience allowed him to become a self-proclaimed leader in training at Albacete before the Lincoln Brigades were sent into battle. However, his leadership qualities were not shown in battle. The first time he was deployed, at the Battle of Brunete, Abramofsky was so terrified by the fighting that he hid and faked injury in a field of wheat and got stretchered away. Milt Wolff, the commander of the Lincoln Brigades, described his own disgust with Abramofsky&rsquo;s behavior, saying that &ldquo;He groaned and moaned on the stretcher as we sweated up the scorching hills, and all the time the son of a bitch had been faking it&hellip;he hadn&rsquo;t been hit at all&rdquo;. Following Brunete, Melofsky claimed in a letter to his friends back home in New York that &ldquo;Cousin Bernie just disappeared someplace, and I don&rsquo;t know where the hell he is&rdquo;. This would mark just the beginning of Abramofsky&rsquo;s attempts to avoid fighting in the Spanish Civil War.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbramofsky and two comrades, Jacob Rotter and Albert Wallach, deserted the Lincoln Brigades and fled to the American consulate in Valencia. On November 22, 1937, they asked to be helped to return to America, based on the claim that they had not enlisted in the cause they initially thought they had. Abramofsky and his comrades stated that they had come to Spain to enlist in a &ldquo;purely American unit&rdquo;, and did not choose to be part of the Republican Army, having been deceived. In exchange for shipping them back to America, Abramofsky and his comrades promised to fully cooperate with the United States in order to prevent more Americans from &ldquo;coming over [to Spain] to be slaughtered&rdquo;. Unfortunately for the deserters, the consulate denied their request, and after learning this, they created a fake story of American dissidents who were falsely court-martialed and then executed by the Republican forces. Lee Worley, the diplomat who heard their story was not fully convinced by it, saying that &ldquo;no doubt, the statements of these boys may be exaggerated&rdquo;. In the end, Worley was unable to help the deserters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing their rejection by the consulate at Valencia, Abramofsky and the others fled to Barcelona in order to try to become repatriated. Like many members of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, Abramofsky had had his passport revoked by the United States after he went over to Spain to fight in the war. Two weeks after leaving Valencia, Abramofsky&rsquo;s repatriation request was rejected in Barcelona. Stephen Fuqua, the US military attache who conducted interviews with Abramofsky and his comrades, stated that &ldquo;they gave the&hellip;impression of being typical cowards fleeing from danger&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the 20th of December, 1937, Abramofsky, Rotter, and Wallach were arrested as deserters. Following his disgraceful exit from the Republican Army, Abramofsky chose to be incarcerated rather than return to the battlefield. This all changed when, during the battle of Teruel, heavy death tolls forced Abramofsky to be taken back to the battlefield to fight for the Republic once again. However, Abramofsky would desert once again following the Republic&rsquo;s retreat from Teruel around February 22nd, 1938.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYet again, Abramofsky would flee to Barcelona, where yet again, he was arrested by the Republic. The authorities took him to the brigade headquarters to be reprimanded by the American forces. While he was completely infuriated and disgusted with Abramofsky&rsquo;s behavior, Commander John Gates made the decision to once again add Abramofsky back to the battalion. However, this decision was not popular among the other commanders of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Following the incredibly costly loss at Teruel, morale was already extremely low, and Abramofsky&rsquo;s presence, considering the fact that he had already deserted on 3 separate occasions, only threatened to make morale even worse. Gates insisted that Abramofsky should stay with the rest of the troops, but uttered under his breath that someone ought to shoot him. And on April 31st, 1938, Gates&rsquo; word became reality. That night, an unknown soldier decided to take matters into his own hands. The soldier took Abramofsky for a walk, and proceeded to fire a single bullet into the back of his skull.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNews of Abramofsky&rsquo;s death spread like a wildfire throughout the camp. Much of the battalion was deeply disturbed by the news. Gates especially was concerned about the murder of Abramofsky, having demanded an answer from Wolff about what had happened to Abramofsky. Wolff &ldquo;claimed total ignorance&rdquo; about what had happened, and the matter would later be dropped as no killer could be identified due to a lack of evidence. Wolff and much of the rest of the commanders of the brigade seemed to be in agreement: that Abramofsky was a threat to the unity of the battalion anyways.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, Wolff&rsquo;s claims of ignorance about the extrajudicial killing of Bernard Abramofsky are highly questionable. In speeches after the war honoring the heroes of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, Wolff has often listed Abramofsky&rsquo;s name along with others who laid down their lives to fight fascism in Spain, despite the fact that Abramofsky abandoned the cause for his own self-preservation. In Wolff&rsquo;s book Another Hill, a semi-fictional autobiography based on his time in the Spanish Civil War, the character Leo Rogin, who is considered to be based on Abramofsky, is killed by a gunshot from Mitch Castle, who is considered to be based on Wolff himself. This has been interpreted as an admission of guilt from Wolff for killing Abramofsky.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbramofsky&rsquo;s story is one that heavily contradicts a common narrative of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, which is that it was a band of noble and brave volunteers who were all putting their lives on the line to protect Spain from falling to Fascism. Some soldiers, like Abramofsky, were cowardly, and were subject to cruelty from their own brethren. In the case of Abramofsky, this cruelty would lead to his untimely demise.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Morris Balter was born on February 13, 1913 in Brooklyn, New York. He got a degree in Chemical Engineering at the City College of New York in 1935. This meant that he specialized in biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics. He then became a laboratory technician and engineer. On March 24, 1937 he received his passport which listed his latest address in the Bronx and on March 27 he sailed for Spain. He made his trip through the boat Paris and he arrived in Spain on April 10. He was a pacifist and served as a non combatant in the war. He served as a field medic and as a lab technician for the XV battalion. He also served with the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion at Villa Paz with the anti gas school in Albacete and he also served with the Republican Medical Service. The Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion was made up of over 1,500 Canadians who fought against fascists in Spain from 1936 to 1939 but the battalion itself was not formed until 1937. Before its forming, Canadian volunteers were part of other battalions like the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and the British one. Just like the United States, Canada was not officially involved in the war but had citizens volunteer to fight with many of them being part of the Communist Party of Canada. He also served as both a doctor and an instructor. During his time in Spain he exchanged multiple letters with his family.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can tell from his letters that he was a family man as he still worried about his parents back home while he was in the middle of a Civil War. He wrote to his parents asking &ldquo;But how about you mom - have you gotten your grippe? Now that you no longer have to work in that unhealthy store you can move into a more healthy atmosphere. As for you pop, I hope you are taking your insulin regularly and seeing a good doctor every few months, both very important if you want to remain in good health.&rdquo; Even as he was surrounded by fighting he still cared about his parents health. He worried when he didn&rsquo;t hear back from them. He also asked about the state of the economy, &ldquo;How is the crisis affecting you? I understand that it is more severe than the one of 1929 with many millions&hellip;&rdquo; And then he described the other soldiers who made up the army, &ldquo;Incidentally there are many Jews here in Spain now - Jews from Germany (Hitler), Italy , Poland, U.S., England, Hungary, Austria&hellip; This is the first time then we able to hit back, united with the Spanish Peoples Army, against the anti-Semite-Fascists Hitler Mussoloini etc.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn his letters he actually suggested that he believed that the Republic was winning, &ldquo;You probably have been reading of the daily bombings by the fascists of Vlaencia, Alcante, Castellon, Barcelona and other cities, towns &amp; villages. The fascists are trying their utmost to retaliate for their loss of &hellip; by murdering the Republican civilians women and children &hellip; because they have suddenly discovered that the Loyalist forces are one too much for them. Cowards - to shower death on defenseless people.&rdquo; You can clearly see how much he cared for the cause and the hatred that he held for the fascists. He mentioned how much it meant to him, &ldquo;This being my 25th birthday and one that finds me with a deeper feeling of satisfaction of accomplishment than any previous birthday.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe also talked about where he was as he moved around in his letters, &ldquo;Where I am right now (as I told you in my last letter - I am no longer at the base hospital because we had an excess of personnel due to the consolidation of the personnel from the &hellip; pilots that were bombed, with the personnel of the base hospital) everything is peace &amp; quite. It, too, once belonged to the royalty&hellip;&rdquo; He then went onto talk about his daily life &ldquo;We get up at 6:30 each morning (with the bugle) - go downstairs on the football field (yes we have a football field, volley ball court, tennis courts&hellip;) for our morning exercises - breakfast at 7:00 AM. - coffee and bread, then we clean our room, make our beds etc until 8:00 when we go to class. Another breakfast at 9 AM. &hellip; To bed at 8:30 P.M. Lights out at 9:00 P.M.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe stayed in Spain until July 12, 1938 when he began the trip back to the U.S. aboard the Aquitania. The Aquatania was a British ocean liner and was very similar in size to the Titanic. It is also actually the last known surviving four funneled ocean liner. He didn&rsquo;t stay away from conflict too long however, as he served in the U.S. army during World War II in the chemical warfare section. Once again he served as a non combatant, this time in Georgia and Okinawa. During the war the U.S. did deploy gas weapons in Europe but they were never used and were just there as a caution. The Chemical Warfare Section instead worked on non chemical warfare related tasks during the war like producing flame tanks. By 1942 there were 60,000 soldiers and civilians employed by the section. Balter served from March 1942 to February 1946 and his rank was a technical sergeant. This was a rank that lasted until 1948 and the rank was above a staff sergeant but below a master one. He married after the war in January of 1949 to his wife Clara and they had two children named Lucille Balter and Joan Balter. During the McCarthy era, Balter changed his name to Martin as he was scared that his service during the Civil War could make him a target of the FBI. He died on April 27, 2008.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Emiliano Mar&iacute;n was born on August 8, 1910, in Jayuya, Puerto Rico. He was raised in Puerto Rico by his parents, Francisco Mar&iacute;n and Maria Torres, until he was fifteen, and then moved to New York on May 25, 1926, with only an elementary school education. He settled in Spanish Harlem, where he would become active within the neighborhood&rsquo;s community of Spanish-speaking immigrants.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn April 15, 1929, at the age of eighteen, Mar&iacute;n enlisted in the 369th Regiment of the New York National Guard&ndash;later known as the Harlem Hellfighters&ndash;as a fireman. He ultimately worked his way up to the rank of Private.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMar&iacute;n became officially affiliated with the Communist Party in April 1934, but he was also associated with the Julio Antonio Mella Club, a Cuban workers&rsquo; club named after the founder of the Cuban Communist party, as well as the International Workers Order (IWO), a mutual aid fraternal society that provided life insurance and encouraged unionization. His interest and involvement in left-wing organizations were what led him to ultimately go to Spain to fight for the Republicans.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMar&iacute;n, like most other volunteers, was smuggled across the Pyrenees Mountains, and he entered Spain through the town of Massanet in Catalonia in July 1937. Fluent in both Spanish and English, he became a prominent interpreter for American and Canadian military units within the Lincoln Battalion while he was receiving training. He achieved the rank of Cabo, or Corporal, and went on to serve in the defensive battles at Quinto and Belchite.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMar&iacute;n also fought in the Republican offensive in Aragon, which resulted in an overwhelming win for the Nationalists and the deaths of many Republicans. Mar&iacute;n, however, survived, and went on to serve in the Ebro offensive, where he was wounded in action on July 30, 1938. He spent one month being treated at a hospital in Catalonia but returned to the offensive for a few more months until his service was cut short: In November 1938, with the situation in Spain growing more and more dangerous, the US consulate urged American volunteers to leave before it was too late. Soon after, on December 2, 1938, Mar&iacute;n&ndash;along with 325 other American volunteers&ndash;crossed the border into France. A week later, he and 323 others boarded the Ausonia back to New York, where they arrived on December 20.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter returning to New York from Spain, Mar&iacute;n took up various jobs, working at one time as a salesman and another as a laborer, for instance. He did not reenlist in the New York National Guard, but he likely continued his involvement within groups like the Communist Party. Mar&iacute;n was presumed to have died in October 1948, at the age of 38, when he was working as a seaman and disappeared at sea from the SS Cuba Victory.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Joseph Anthony Santalucia (also spelled Santa Lucia) was born on September 11, 1910 in New York City to an Italian family. A Park Slope, Brooklyn resident (7023 13th Street) he lived among other Italian and Irish immigrants and their descendants. He also lived in Manhattan Beach (35 Norfolk Street), which also had a significant Italian and Jewish population. He attended grade school for eight years and was fluent in English, Italian, and Spanish. He did not complete high school and instead entered the workforce. Like many other Italians, he worked as a seaman and stevedore, responsible for maintaining ships and unloading cargo. His time at the docks and having experience with ships would later shape his experiences beyond the Spanish Civil War. More immediate however was the Great Depression, which affected Santalucia like most it did for other Americans. 19 years old at the time, Santalucia found himself, as many other Americans did, struggling to make a living. His last job before traveling to Spain was as a dock worker employed by the United Fruit Company on Pier 9 in Brooklyn, near his Park Slope residence. He earned only 30 dollars per week, which is around 1,500 dollars per year, or about 27,000 dollars in 2023.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter years of struggle, Santalucia joined the Communist Party of the United States in 1935 while in California. He was also a member of the International Longshoreman Association (ILA), which was part of the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Santalucia was an active member of his union; he helped lead a New York strike of about 500 longshoremen in November of 1935 and was a representative of the ILA to their employers for three months. He had been arrested three times in demonstrations, riots, and strikes, but all were minor and he was not prosecuted, though this did lead to his expulsion from the ILA. He then applied for a passport soon after hearing of the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July of 1936. There wasn&rsquo;t much for him in the US: his job at the docks was seasonal, and his parents had already passed away. Thus, the decision to go likely came without much hesitation or resistance from those around him. He changed his name to the English-sounding Sands, possibly to obscure his Italian background to prevent association with Fascist Italy. Around six months later, on February 17th, 1937, he received his passport. Three days later, he boarded the SS Ile de France, one of the most luxurious ocean liners of the time. It was a fleeting comfort given his destination: the battlefields and bullet-ridden cities of Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn March 2nd, 1937, Santalucia arrived in Figueres, Spain, just below the French border, after crossing the mountains. He soon after joined the Spanish Communist Party (PCE). His prior experience working with boats was of no use in a land-based army, thus like most other American volunteers, he was inexperienced and faced the same inadequate training. At first, he was a plana mayor, or staff member, working as a cook for the XV International Brigade. By June, he was placed into the 1st Company of the Washington Brigade as a soldado, or private, to help take the Jarama Valley. He also fought in the Brunete offensive and Battle of Teruel. Though he was later moved to the 3rd Company, he remained a soldado throughout the war. During the retreats, on April 9th, 1938, he deserted the Brigade, taking a train up north back to the mountains. Santalucia was arrested in the town of Portbou, right on the border of France. He was arrested on April 14th and brought back to Figueres, where he claimed he had gotten drunk and did not intend to desert. His membership in the PCE was nonetheless revoked, but he returned for the fateful Ebro Offensive where he fought with dedication and was cited for exemplary conduct, but later wounded by shrapnel in August 1938. He was hospitalized at Hospital de Vic in the city of Vic, about 40 miles north of Barcelona. He may have visited the farewell parade in Barcelona in October. In November, he reapplied to the PCE. In a letter, Santalucia revealed that he deserted because he was being accused of sabotage and holding secret meetings during the retreats. Instead of reporting to the Brigade authorities as he was ordered to, he fled for the French border in fear, intending to cross the mountains and return to the United States. He was sent back to the United States the following month, and the PCE was thus unable to reapprove his membership. Leaving from Le Havre, France, he arrived in New York City on December 20th, 1938, on the RMS Ausonia, with 50 other Spanish Civil War veterans.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBack in New York City, Santalucia likely took up dock and ship work to sustain himself. It was during this time he joined the National Maritime Union (NMU). He spent only a few years in the city before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, and he was once again drawn to the fight against fascism. This time, benefitting from his experience working on the docks of Brooklyn, he joined the US Navy. He sailed on the USS Catclaw, a net laying ship, in 1943, before moving to the Ford County, a tank landing ship. Afterwards, he served on the Kearny, a destroyer part of an Atlantic convoy whose destinations included Spain. Towards the end of the war, he sailed on the Stockton, which fought its way through the Pacific against the Japanese Empire, supporting the US Army in the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Santalucia was discharged from the military in May of 1946 and was done fighting wars for good.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow a veteran of two wars, Santalucia returned home to New York City once more. His communist fervor had cooled down by now, and he was settling into the relatively peaceful post-war years of the 1950s. At some point, he married a wife from a foreign country and had a son named Victor, and later moved to California for some time. He also ran for 1st Alternate within the NMU, but he did not win. In 1953 he testified against Kwong Hai Chew, a Chinese American permanent resident and seaman who was a union officer of the NMU. Chew, who was seeking to become a naturalized citizen of the United States, was detained in Ellis Island, NYC. In his immigration hearing, he was accused of being a communist and thus dangerous to be granted citizenship. Santalucia and two other NMU members provided testimony that Chew was a communist, which led to a ruling to deport Chew on the grounds that he was a dangerous foreign communist that presented an active threat to the country. (Chew challenged the ruling, which was later reversed by the District of Appeals). Proceedings against Chew continued in 1958 and 1964, and Santalucia was present at all three hearings. Ultimately, Chew was naturalized in 1967, but Santalucia&rsquo;s role remains controversial. It is unclear if his claims about Chew were true, and his decision to cooperate with the FBI led his fellow Spanish Civil War veterans to shun him. Many of his fellow veterans were targeted by the FBI for being communist as well. Santalucia may have been trying to clear himself of any affiliations with communism, or there may have been other reasons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSantalucia died in June of 1982, in Lake Placid, NY.

        "data": "<p>On October 3rd, 1907 Stanley Etela was born in the city of Schenectady, New York. His Finnish origin suggests that his parents immigrated to avoid growing hostility from Russia during a time of Russification. Etela later made his home in Williamsburg at 228 Metropolitan Avenue, Brooklyn, New York as a tailor. However, he was not exempt from the economic hardships of the Great Depression that later came. Thus, in 1933, Etela was inspired to join the Communist Party of the United States, taking part in the collective initiative to fight the Depression. He participated in strikes and rallies, helping bring unions to previously unorganized trades and backing civil rights movements.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt this point, Williamsburg was one the most densely populated areas of New York City because of an influx of people coming from other parts of the city and various places in Europe. This was especially true during a wave of Jewish immigrants seeking to escape Nazism in the 1930s. As a member of such an active community as New York, Etela&rsquo;s proximity to European affairs drew his attention to Spain and the mutiny against a democratically elected Republican government in 1936. Despite the risk of losing his citizenship in a desperately neutral America, Etela joined a call by the Communist Party to fight the &ldquo;Good Fight&rdquo; in Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnder the name of &ldquo;Stanley Stala&rdquo; and an innocuous excuse to visit France, Etela sailed aboard the Paris in February with 118 other volunteers, also with innocuous excuses to go. Ten days later he was officially in Spain, and Etela was surrounded by a truly International Brigade, with volunteers from all over the world gathered for the same cause. As one of the enthusiastic young Americans, he was of the XV International Brigade, or The Abraham Lincoln Brigade. The setting was so international, in fact, that commanders spoke several languages and hardly gave instruction in English. Training was minimal and incomprehensible to the fresh faced American volunteers. Etela and his inexperienced comrades, after only getting a few shots with weapons they had never seen before, were often sent first into battle as fodder so more experienced soldiers could come in later.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSoon, Etela would be sent to his first battle as part of the Jarama offensive, and would march with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in an attempt to take the Pingarron. As part of the 2nd Company of the XV Brigade, Etela departed from Albacete crammed inside one of several trucks. Luckily, he was not aboard one of the first two trucks that missed a turn and drove straight into enemy lines, dubbed &ldquo;The Lost Trucks.&rdquo; This would not be the last of their mishaps, as weather, miscommunication, and a lack of promised arms led the Lincoln Brigade and many others marching into a barrage of bullets. It was only rain that provided enough cover from Nationalist snipers for survivors to find cover. At this point, Etela and others like him were faced with the reality of war. Four months later, they would advance Westward across the Guadarrama River for the Battle of Brunete. Hilly landscape and the Nationalists&rsquo; advantageous positioning at Villanueva de la Canada made the XV Brigade open to bombardment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUltimately, Etela would be wounded in action. He would then be discharged from the 15th Brigade and moved to the rear. Soon after in August 1938, he would be evacuated from Sagaro back to America aboard the President Roosevelt.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Boleslav Wawrzykowski was born on April 17, 1916, in Brooklyn, New York, to Polish parents. It isn&rsquo;t known whether his parents themselves were immigrants from Poland, but this seems plausible, given the year of his birth, as two of the 20 million southern and eastern European immigrants who arrived in the United States between 1880 and 1920. Wawrzykowski completed just one year of high school before dropping out, and at some point during his younger years moved to Poland, where he lived until 1933. He returned to Brooklyn, where he lived on Wythe Avenue in Williamsburg and worked as a radio mechanic, a trade he may have learned in Poland or after leaving high school.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three years later, when the nationalist military forces in Spain staged a coup d&rsquo;etat, Wawrzykowski found a different calling. He was an anti-fascist, and the possibility of fascist rule in another European country was untenable. So, Wawrzykowski, through the Communist party, found himself aboard the <em>Aquitania </em>on June 2, 1937, sailing for Setcases, Spain. Twenty days later, the ship arrived at a port in Catalonia, and Wawrzykowski stepped ashore as an anti-fascist volunteer in the 15th International Brigade, which contained volunteers from the United States, Britain, Spain, and parts of eastern Europe, which suited the trilingual Wawrzykowski well (he spoke, English, Polish, and Russian).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was a member of the Washington Battalion, and first saw action with them at the Battle of Brunete, in July of 1937, a piece in the larger struggle for control of Madrid. Brunete was a town located on the outskirts of Madrid, and the Republican forces attacked it in an attempt to relieve some of the pressure of the Nationalist assault. While initially successful, the Republicans eventually were forced to retreat due to the devastating casualties inflicted upon them. The Washington Battalion alone lost close to half of its volunteers, and was later merged with the Lincoln Battalion, as the deaths were too difficult to quickly replace.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wawrzykowski continued to fight with the new combined battalion, nearly dying at Fuentes de Ebro when a plane exploded in front of his trench, until November 25, 1938, when he returned home aboard the <em>Manhattan</em>. He lived at a couple addresses in the city, staying in Manhattan upon his return, before moving back to Brooklyn, where he shared an address with a friend named Sam Jagan. Wawrzykowski worked at the American Holding Umbrella Company for a man named Charles Laden until Jun 5, 1941, when he enlisted in the US Army to fight in World War II. Curiously, military documents identify him as single, but he claimed in one letter to have a &ldquo;Spanish wife.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Staff Sergeant Wawrzykowski (though he described himself as a &ldquo;Radio Sergeant&rdquo;) initially was stationed in Hawaii, though by July of 1944 he had come back stateside, at that point being stationed at Camp Howze, in Texas. Wawrzykowski remained committed to the Lincoln Brigade, though, writing numerous letters while serving to other former volunteers requesting issues of <em>Volunteer for Liberty</em>, a newspaper run by other volunteers, as well as records from the war. Wawrzykowski also wrote that he felt discriminated against as an anti-fascist and thought that he&rsquo;d been turned down promotions for his beliefs. In one letter, he wondered openly whether he was fighting on the side of fascism or anti-fascism. Wawrzykowski had requested to go to China, and later to Italy, but his requests had been denied.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a member of the 32nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop, Wawrzykowski went to Normandy in mid 1944, where he suffered an ankle injury while taking shelter from enemy fire, for which he was admitted to a hospital. On March 3, 1945, while fighting in Germany, Wawrzykowski was shot in the neck and killed. He was buried at a United States Air Force cemetery in Santa Barbara, California.</p>\r\n",

The eldest son out of five, Barsky and his family spent two years living with relatives in Woromin, Poland before emigrating to New York in 1923 through Ellis Island. According to Ellis Island records, the Zabarski family boarded the Minnekahda and arrived at Ellis Island on February 25th, 1923, when Benjamin was listed as being five years old.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Zabarski family settled in the Bronx, selling fish in a small store on E.180th Street, and eventually changed their last name to Barsky. Benjamin graduated from James Monroe High School before attending the City College of New York. He became active in the Young Communist League in 1934, and soon after, the Communist Party.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBarsky received his passport in April of 1937, where he was listed as being in his mid-twenties. He sailed aboard the American Importer, whose passengers claimed to be on a holiday trip to France. The ship arrived in Liverpool on May 17, 1937. The ship was already under American State Department surveillance, so a British immigration officer forwarded the list of all passengers on the ship to the American Consulate in Liverpool. On these records, Barsky was listed as a 22 year old student. The ship then sailed to Cherbourg, France, before crossing the Pyrenees Mountains into Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the town of Tarazona, Barsky trained with the Mackenzie-Papineau (Mac-Paps) Battalion, which, despite being a Canadian unit, included many American volunteers. He quickly rose through the ranks, serving as a Cabo (corporal) and later an acting Teniente (Lieutenant) in the war.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn July 24, 1938, Barsky and the Mac-Paps crossed the Ebro via rowboats, rafts, and any flotation devices they could find. The volunteers were a part of the campaign to stop the Fascists from capturing the Republican capital of Valencia, which would cut the Republic in half. Very quickly, the Republicans were able to open a 50km front, and are armed with rifles, grenades, and machine guns. Along with British and Spanish Battalions, the Mac-Paps took the town of Asco, moved into the town of Corbera, and were then deployed on the Gandesa-Corbera road on their way towards Gandesa.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn order to make it to Gandesa, Republican troops needed to beat out the heavily fortified Fascist forces that controlled Hill 481, known as &ldquo;the Pimple&rdquo;. On August 1st, the Mac-Paps relieved the British battalions that had just been badly mauled by Fascist forces in their attempts to make it up Hill 481. During this fighting at the Battle of the Ebro, Barsky was killed in action on August 10, 1938.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Daniel Alvin Pasternack (spelled Pasternak on some records) was born on July 20, 1914. Daniel was born to two Jewish polish-born immigrants, Joseph and Barbara Pasternak, who had immigrated to America sometime in the late 19th or early 20th century: some immigration documents show a certain Joseph Pasternak immigrating to the U.S.A. in 1883, although it is unclear whether he was the same man as Daniel&rsquo;s father.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 19th century, Poland as a state did not exist, instead the land was partitioned among multiple Eastern and Central European powers. Judging by the information provided in Joseph&rsquo;s immigration documents, he was likely from the Eastern part of Poland, the region under Russian jurisdiction. This would not have boded well for Joseph and his family, given their Jewish heritage. Among other things, Jews in Poland had to worry about <em>pogroms</em>, slavic riots aimed at Jewish villages, as well as state-induced poverty. Jews were expected to produce young men for the military, pay double the taxes of their slavic neighbours, and were barred from owning land or participating in certain industries, such as brewing. These factors contributed greatly to the decision of Daniel&rsquo;s parents, as well as many other Jews residing in Poland, to immigrate to the U.S. through Ellis Island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite economic hardship and rampant anti-semitism in America, especially during the early 20th century, Daniel was able to gain access to a higher education. This may be due to the fact that his father Joseph himself was educated, or at the very least literate, as indicated on his immigration documents. A U.S. census shows him residing in Suffolk, Brookhaven at 16 years old meaning that in all likelihood he was attending the only high school in Brookhaven at the time: Bellport High School. After high school he studied at Columbia University in New York City. While there is no record of what he studied, there is a record that he went on to be a Mechanical Engineer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether he was radicalized at school, or more likely in university, by 1935 he was a member of the Young Communist League, a youth organization focused on educating future communists and contributing to the working class struggle. It also seems that in 1935 he may have been a member of the Communist Party. The American Communist Party, founded in 1919, saw rapid growth in the 1930&rsquo;s as a reaction to fascist movements in Europe, as well as unemployment due to the great depression. In America the party mainly focused on popularizing unions and helping them negotiate against inhumane employers; however, it also held globalist views and closely followed the rise of fascism in Europe. Eventually, the Communist Party would send thousands of Americans to fight Franco in Spain, Daniel among them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On June 5, 1937 Daniel received his first passport, which just one week later he would use to travel outside the country for the first time. Interestingly enough, he listed his secondary addresses in Tampa, Florida. How and why a first generation Polish-American Jewish mechanical engineer held a second address in Florida is a mystery, but given that his primary address was 215 East 18th street, right next to Gramercy Park, it is entirely possible he was relatively well off by his mid 20&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On June 12, 1937, just seven days after receiving his passport, he set sail on the <em>Georgic, </em>a brand new motorship which regularly traveled between New York, London, Southampton, and Le Havre (a port in Northern France). In 1940, the <em>Georgic</em> too would go on to fight the fascists, only in World War 2, as a troopship. After setting foot on land once again somewhere in North-Western Europe, Daniel proceeded south and crossed the Spanish-French border somewhere around Setcases, a mountainous region on the northeastern side of Spain, not far from Barcelona.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Daniel joined the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, an international battalion fighting under the XV Brigade, aka the Lincoln Brigade, his trail went dark. Aside from a brief photoshoot of his brigade, where Daniel appears in two of the pictures, no records are kept of Daniel&rsquo;s time at the front. Even the pictures are misdated, claiming they were taken 6 months after his death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel resurfaces once again at the Fuentes de Ebro, arguably among the most disastrous battles for the republic throughout the whole war. On October 13th (or, according to one source, 16th), Daniel Pasternack died to aircraft strafing, a common tactic in which a low-flying aircraft is mounted with an automatic weapon which fires at stationary targets. Because Franco&rsquo;s air force was&nbsp; largely supplemented by German aircrafts and pilots, it is likely that Daniel was among the first Americans to be killed by the Luftwaffe, which would go on to battle the British Royal Airforce in the sky. Daniel Pasternack lived a short life defined by one decision and the four months that followed it. This one decision, and the sacrifice that followed, transformed him from an average, if somewhat successful man, to a hero worth remembering and commemorating.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Mabel Irene Spiegel, originally Mabel Irene Goldin, was born on January 2nd, 1910 in Brooklyn, New York. Her parents, Rose and Isidore Goldin, were two of the two million Russian Jews who escaped the antisemitic violence of the Russian pogroms (riots) that began in the 1880s.They managed to evade the emigration restrictions put in place in imperial Russia during the decades prior and likely made their way to America through the Castle Garden depot or Ellis Island. They settled in 1030 14th Street in Midwood, one of Brooklyn&rsquo;s many Russian ethnic enclaves. At the time, New York City had few well-paying jobs available to third-wave immigrants (those who immigrated to America from 1880 to 1914) such as themselves, but her father managed to become a proficient businessman and open a men&rsquo;s clothing store that lasted even through the Great Depression. However, he was a poker gambler and the Goldins sometimes struggled to raise a family. Spiegel was the youngest of three children and felt that she was sometimes &ldquo;badly mistreated&rdquo; by her parents. She bitterly recalls that she was only allowed to own &ldquo;one dress at a time&rdquo; despite the plentiful clothing that her siblings owned. Perhaps Spiegel&rsquo;s childhood experiences explain the mental fortitude she displayed later in life in Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThough Spiegel&rsquo;s exact schooling is unclear, it is suspected that she attended the Brooklyn Jewish Center Academy as a young child, which was the oldest surviving Jewish day school in America until its closing in 1985. Spiegel later moved from Brooklyn to 230 West 99th Street in Manhattan Valley. Despite being accepted to train at the prestigious Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York, she chose to complete her education at the Battle Creek School of Nursing in Michigan (the only Jewish student in a class of 300), which was an institution open for a brief period of time from 1923 to 1938. Nursing students in the 1930s were generally required to complete three years of schooling, which was priced at roughly 35 dollars per year. The investment paid off: once she became a nurse, she earned 35 dollars per week. Her education proved crucial in her development from a hardworking medical student to a nurse with a passion for saving lives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a young and educated nurse, Spiegel was a member of the Communist Party of the United States. Four-fifths of the Communists living in New York City were immigrants at the time, and while not an immigrant herself, Spiegel most definitely found a community of like-minded Americans with Eastern European Jewish descent. She first heard of the Spanish Civil War through a flyer distributed by her trade union (United Professionals) that was recruiting medical workers for the American Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy. In April of 1937, she attended a presentation advertised on the Bureau flyer. The description of the impassioned fighting of the Spanish Republic against General Francisco Franco&rsquo;s encroaching forces no doubt stirred a fervor inside of her. Following the meeting, she applied to be a military nurse in Spain, passed the medical exam, and was given an interview where they asked one question: why did she want to go to Spain? She answered, &ldquo;to help fight facism&rdquo;. The Bureau accepted her immediately; she was to leave in a month. Privately, Spiegel admitted that her reasons for going were not quite so ideological as she made them out to be, but rather that she simply &ldquo;liked a little bit of adventure.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn May 17th, 1937, at the age of 27, Spiegel received her passport and began preparing for her departure to Spain. Like many other young volunteers at the time, she chose to not inform her parents of her decision to go, as she &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t want there to be any fuss&rdquo;, especially since her brother had passed recently. Ten days later, shortly after the resignation of Largo Caballero as Prime Minister of the Spanish Republic, she arrived in the war-torn country on the S.S. Normandie with 20 other medical volunteers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpiegel began working with the Medical Service immediately and worked at both local hospitals on the battlefront (Aragon, Murcia, and Teruel) as well as larger hospitals commanded by the International Health Service. Spiegel was commended for her diligence at nearly every hospital she worked at. Her personal file reported her as &ldquo;professional and intelligent&rdquo;. She was described by a patient, Harry Shepard, as a sweet nurse who was able to &ldquo;dig up buttered toast, canned peaches, cigarets [sic] and chocolate out of thin air sometimes&rdquo;. But life in Spain was not always sweet. Two months after her initial arrival in Spain, Spiegel experienced working behind the lines of her first major offensive. The Battle of Brunete, which lasted 19 days from July 6th, 1937, was a major offensive launched by the Republic in the hopes of liberating Madrid from Franco&rsquo;s forces. It was a bloody campaign with roughly 40,000 casualties. Of the 900 American soldiers who served, 600 were killed or wounded. When the fighting began, Spiegel was working as ward nurse at the divisional hospital under the esteemed Catalan surgeon Moises Broggi with surgical nurse Esther Silverstein (a fellow Abraham Lincoln Brigadier and a San Francisco native). Under the watchful guidance of Dr. Broggi, the pair were an efficient team commended for completing thirty operations in twenty hours and saving the lives of many soldiers wounded in the offensive. Their medical team boasted the lowest fatality rate among those seriously injured in the offensive. Spiegel in particular was admired for her determination. It was said that she worked for five days in a row without rest and encouraged the other nurses by proclaiming, &ldquo;a soldier doesn&#39;t leave his post before being relieved! We work for Spain, for glory and for Dr. Broggi!&rdquo; As a result of their valiant efforts, the divisional hospital was rewarded with a new ambulance from Doctor Oscar Telge, head of the International Health Service. Despite the glory, the battle left a large emotional impact on Spiegel. She noted repeatedly in her later life the story of how she cared for the dying Gerda Taro, a famed German war photographer who was the first female photojournalist to die covering the frontlines in a war. Spiegel mournfully recalled that &ldquo;she [Taro] had the whole side of her body injured&rdquo; because she was crushed by a tank while photographing the war and that her last words to Spiegel were &ldquo;what&#39;s happened to my cameras?&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDue to the various locations of the battles, military nurses often worked at several hospitals over the span of a few months. After the Brunete offensive, Spiegel relocated to a ward at La Puebla de Hijar, an extremely small town in Teruel. After several months, she relocated once again and began working as head nurse at the Vic Hospital, a position she occupied from June to August of 1938. It was at the last hospital she worked at, the British Hospital in Matar&oacute;, Barcelona, where she met her husband. Harry Spiegel, a brigadier from Austria, was the political commissar in the 4th Battalion of the 11th Interbrigade. He had been wounded in the Battle of the Ebro in the summer of 1938. Upon being treated by Spiegel, the two rapidly fell in love and married in September of the same year. She shed her maiden name upon marriage and took on the name Spiegel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs one of the last Americans to leave Spain, Spiegel was committed to the end. But on February 7th or 8th, 1939, she had no choice but to evacuate from S&#39;Agar&oacute; to France with her husband. Upon arrival in France, her husband was captured in an internment camp for five months as an &ldquo;enemy alien&rdquo; due to his Austrian background. However, Spiegel was able to visit and negotiate his release because the French government had mistakenly given Spiegel full authority to travel despite her refugee status. The couple remained in Marseilles to wait for Harry&rsquo;s visa but by June of 1940, Nazi Germany had turned its attention to France. Unable to leave France upon this outbreak of World War II, the couple watched as yet another war tore apart their temporary home. They found refuge with others who had fought in Spain in the Cazaux-Debat commune in the Pyrenees, where Spiegel gave birth to her son Peter in 1941. The couple later found work at a children&rsquo;s refuge run in Baroness de Rothschild&rsquo;s chateau. In 1943, Spiegel and her husband donned forged identities and joined the anti-Nazi resistance movement that had sprung up when Vichy France was established in the summer of 1940. When World War II ended, Spiegel&rsquo;s husband returned to Vienna, Austria. Spiegel chose to remain in France with her son to head the Southern French branch of the Unitarians&rsquo; Universalist Service Committee Refugee Aid Office in Marseilles. There, she distributed food, clothing, and financial aid to vulnerable refugees, paying special attention to those who had escaped or been released from Franco&rsquo;s internment camps. In 1947, she left her job and joined her husband in Vienna because she &ldquo;felt that a child [Peter] needed to be with his father&rdquo;. Spiegel returned to the United States once for only a year in 1947 to live with her mother-in-law before settling permanently in Vienna. The post-Civil War years were exceedingly hard on Spiegel; she had contracted tuberculosis, was experiencing marital issues, and often had to care for the young Peter alone. She encapsulates the years in a simple phrase: &ldquo;I was working too hard.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite the Republic&rsquo;s loss in the war and her own personal losses, she expressed no regret in her participation in the Spanish Civil War. When she visited Madrid in 1996 on the occasion of Spain&rsquo;s Homenaje to the Civil War Volunteers, she explained: &ldquo;The International Brigades did not fight and lose their lives in vain. I&rsquo;m always glad that I went to Spain. I&rsquo;ve felt that was the great, great achievement of my life.&rdquo; She died at age ninety three on January 15th, 2004 and is survived by her two children Peter and Ilse.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Nils Mil(t)o Kruth was born on the 24th of December of 1899 in Helsinki, Finland to Frank and Mathilda Kruth. Much of his early life is not known, but he immigrated to America with his parents when he was twelve years old. They settled in Brooklyn(the address is not known).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter he graduated from high school(it is not known which high school he went to), he went to study at the City University of New York. After that, he did graduate work at New York University and Columbia. He worked as a teacher before going to serve in the Spanish Civil War.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the 1930s, he worked as an organizer for the Communist party in Ironwood, Michigan and Superior, Wisconsin. By 1938, he was married to Helen Kruth and they would travel extensively(it is not known where he traveled to).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe got his passport in March of 1937 and the passport listed his address as 337 West 71st Street in Lincoln Square, Manhattan. Sometime in March of the same year, he went over to Spain aboard the Manhattan to serve in the Spanish Civil War as part of the XV brigade. He would first join the Washington Battalion and fight as part of its Machine Gun Company. He was the adjutant commander in the Washington Battalion. The Washington Battalion was led by Mirko Markovics, who gave rigorous training and shaped the volunteers into somewhat proper soldiers. The soldiers had consistent training and high morale, even after setbacks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause of the large casualties in previous battles that Kruth was not a part of, the Washington Battalion would soon merge with the Lincoln Battalion, where he would continue the fight as a Section Leader of the Machine Gun Company. The Lincoln Battalion would go on to accept other nationalities and soon Spaniards outnumbered Americans within the battalion. He would later be promoted to Adjutant Commander and eventually Company Commander.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe was wounded at his first and last major battle, the Battle of Brunete. It was a leg wound and took him months to recover. When he eventually recovered, he became a training officer at Tarazona. He was in Spain from April of 1937 to August of 1938. During his time in Spain, he would have used a version of the modern machine gun.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe eventually went back home aboard the Manhattan, where he continued traveling extensively with his wife and organized extensively in the Northeast are of the USA.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the late 1940s, he settled down and bought land in Trumansburg, New York. He worked as a farmer on this piece of land, until his death in the October 27, 1964.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Louis H. Gordon was born in 1915 in Brooklyn, New York to Hyman and Rachel Gordon. He attended Boys High School, which is in Bedford-Stuyvesant and now a historical landmark. The school is known for its Victorian style design and has several famous alumni. After graduating, Gordon worked for Sulphite &amp; Paper Mill Workers as a union organizer. Louis then moved on to attend the Labor Relations School of Cornell University, where he was exposed to the circumstances of Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLouis Gordon joined the fight in Spain through The Communist Internationals, the communist parties of several nations, which recruited people to fight in Spain. The Communist Internationals would interview the recruits and have a physical check-up done on them to make sure they were fighting for their cause. While Louis himself was not a communist, he felt that many of his interests did align with the Communist Party, such as trade union activity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo get to Spain, the volunteers had to walk over the Pyrenees mountains to avoid troops who were put on the route necessary to cross it by the League of Nations. They were led by a Spanish smuggler who helped them travel through the Pyrenees to Spain. The smuggler forced the volunteers to climb the mountains that looked &ldquo;impossible&rdquo;, as Gordon called it because they never had any troops on them. They did suffer a few casualties on the harsh trip.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter that trip, Gordon went to Cordoba, serving as the truck driver for several other volunteers, who he would not see again for six months. He fought at Cordoba six months later, where Francisco Franco tried to cut off Valencia from Madrid, which would give him complete control of the southern half of Spain. After this battle, they had to cross the Ebro river which proved to be a difficult task.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGordon next fought in Teruel, where Gordon and the volunteers fought and drove Franco&rsquo;s army out. The battle was one of the bloodier battles of the Spanish Civil War. Gordon tried to help take men who were wounded from the battle to any areas nearby that would treat them nearby, but they were denied treatment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGordon then also fought in the Battle of the Ebro, which was the largest battle of the Spanish Civil War, in order to take Franco&rsquo;s armies by surprise. He suffered a wound to his eye during this battle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter Gordon returned from Spain, Gordon was drafted for World War II, where he was involved with anti-aircraft warfare. He also served as a sergeant with the Combat Engineers of the seventh army. He was among the first troops that freed the Dachau concentration camp in April 1945.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the war, Gordon continued his work with unions until retiring in 1985. He wrote in the union&rsquo;s newspaper for thirty-three years. When he retired, he became the director of the Paperworkers Retiree program. Then, in 1998, he became a consultant of the union health and welfare fund.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn his final years, Gordon advocated for the Ulster County Consumer Fraud Bureau, which awarded him the Pride of Ulster County Award for his community service. Lous Gordon died on March 25, 2006, at 91 years old.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Helen Freeman Feinberg was a nurse in the Spanish Civil War. She was born on March 19, 1914, in New York of Jewish descent. She trained as a nurse in Brooklyn Jewish Hospital. When she was 22 years old, a few months into her career, she decided to join the Medical Bureau in Aid Spanish Democracy. She was not a member of any political party during this time, but she went as she felt that democracy was being challenged against people. She arrived in Spain on January 16, 1937, and returned on June 6, 1938.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Spain, she worked as a frontline nurse. She was present in the battles of Jarama, Belchite, and Gandesa. She was one of approximately 50 American nurses. In an interview, she mentioned that she would not be able to sleep without her silk pajamas and would always carry water and soap in her bag. Like many U.S. nurses, Freeman introduced professional nursing practice for those who were not qualified in Spain; she was successful in helping the wounded even with the lack of resources. Freeman was fierceless in battle, even amongst explosions and ambulance chaos.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March of 1938, there was a bombing at a hospital in Hijar. Freeman sustained massive injuries; it was reported that she suffered a skull fracture and an upper arm injury due to enemy shrapnels. Due to the injury, she was not allowed to become a nurse for World War II later in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After she was dispensed, she instead served in helping clinics in areas of Peru and Ecuador. During World War II, Freeman worked with displaced people in Germany and later worked with migrant farmworkers in Oregon and Idaho. She also joined the American Joint Distribution Committee and continued to work as a nurse in New York City and California.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with all of her dedication, she was mislabeled as a communist and was continuously questioned by the FBI during the 1950s. The main reason for the skepticism was due to her time in Spain and her progressive point of view. Despite this, she continued to show her support for her fellow nurses in Spain and attend events such as the 53rd Anniversary Dinner for Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the 1970s to her death, she lived in Orange County, California, working as a school nurse. She died due to cancer on February 22, 1999, only a month before her 85th birthday. She has a son and a daughter and two grandsons. The Whittier Elementary School in California named a facility the Costa Mesa Feinberg Hall in honor of Freeman and her husband, Charles Feinberg.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Israel Erwin Sandipher was born on March 9, 1890 in Hamilton, Ohio, the fifth of seven children to James (b. 1855) and Pocahontas (b. 1862, nee Hebron) Sandipher. As African American southerners, James coming from South Carolina and Pocahontas from Washington, D.C, both parents were most likely freed slaves: James freed at 7 years old and Pocahontas as a newborn. Although the exact origin of the name Sandipher is unknown&ndash;their family is the only documented use of that name on record&ndash;it is likely that James took and slightly modified his owner&rsquo;s name (many slave owners, including a number in South Carolina, had the surname &ldquo;Sandifer&rdquo;), as did many other freed slaves.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter a childhood and young adulthood in Hamilton, at age 27 Sandipher was drafted for World War 1, at the time living at 931 Wade St. in Cincinnati, Ohio. After his return he settled in New York City, eventually finding residence at 50 E. 13th street. He took up a job as an Auto Mechanic, and likely maintained a stable income until the stock crash of 1929, sending millions into economic hardship and poverty. Whether due to his own economic hardship, disillusionment with the recently collapsed American system of capitalism, or both, Sandipher joined the American Communist Party in 1932.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe party itself had begun as a coalition completely lacking black members, despite the socialist perspective on slavery being extremely antagonistic at the time. However by 1920 the party began a campaign to intensively recruit black members, especially those of an internationalist bent. During the early 1930s, the party was particularly active in urban areas. including New York City. It was here, in fact, where the party launched an economic boycott of Jewish and Italian businesses that refused to hire black workers, under the slogan &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Buy Where You Can&rsquo;t Work&rdquo; This might have been attractive to Sandipher, as a black worker in New York City.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt this point the party had begun to tailor its campaign for unity against fascism to appeal to the black community, specifically in its opposition to the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935. Continuing this trend, black members, including Sandipher in 1937, went to fight in the Spanish Civil War.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSandipher is documented in the Jewish Virtual Library&rsquo;s catalog of Jews who fought in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, seemingly conflicting with Sandipher&rsquo;s African-American heritage. To clear this up, the catalog points out that many of the names documented are not confirmed to come from actual Jews, rather non-Jews with Jewish-sounding names. Sandipher&rsquo;s mother, Pocahontas, was born with the surname Hebron, a name of distinctly semitic origin, which may indicate either Jewish faith or connection to it, explaining in part Sandipher&rsquo;s first name. (His siblings had similar, biblical names including Joseph, Aaron, and Mary)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe racial makeup and dynamic of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade was unprecedented in the history of American military forces. In all previous wars, including World War 1, black soldiers served under the command of white officers, whereas here, many African-Americans rose to prominent commanding roles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSandipher arrived in Spain on April 2, shortly after the largely futile Battle of Jarama on February 27, in which the Brigade suffered great losses, losing two-thirds of its fighting body. As a result of this loss Sandipher was likely met with minimal, rushed training in an attempt to quickly bolster the Brigade&rsquo;s then diminished forces. The first documented battle Sandipher fought in was the Battle of Brunete, a well-prepared offensive against Nationalist forces in the Nationalist-controlled town of Brunete. By the end of the battle the ALB had joined forces with the George Washington Battalion, who had already sustained heavy casualties in previous engagements. This partnership of regiments led to general military success at the following series of Battles at the Aragon Offensive, including both Quinto and Belchite, the intense house-to-house combat of which Sandipher and many of his peers were lucky to survive. After the final, unsuccessful engagement at Fuentes de Ebro, where casualties were heavy due to an uncoordinated advance of Russian tanks, the Brigade was able to enjoy an extended period of rest and relaxation, to the relief of many of its troops.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSandipher would fight in his last major battle in the Ebro offensive, a first stalwart push back into captured territory that ended in a last - minute shift to defense for the Republicans after crossing the Ebro River. The sentiment of African-American fighters at that time was largely against returning to America. Tom Page, a fellow black New Yorker, remarked that Spain was &ldquo;the first time that I ever felt like a free man.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReturning to New York again from his second international war, by 1942 Sandipher was left unemployed. In perhaps an effort to continue his crusade against fascism, or a way out of a jobless existence, he registered for service on the 15th of February, 1942. His participation in World War Two likely saw a regression from his last experience in active duty, as, like in World War One, black soldiers were often assigned non-combatant roles, behind the front lines. Israel Erwin Sandipher died on December 27, 1969, by then a veteran in three wars, all fought overseas. Although it is unknown whether he continued his membership in the Communist Party of USA until his death, his values still likely centered on socialism, despite the souring and destruction of Stalin and the U.S.S.R&rsquo;s image.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Gustav Klieger was born on September 14th, 1916 in New York City. Born to and likely raised by a single Jewish mother, Rose Switzky, Gustav attended high school for only two years before becoming a seaman at the age of 15. An active member of maritime strikes, Klieger was also a member of the Youth Communist League, which he joined no later than May of 1937. The Great Depression and the turn towards the &ldquo;Popular Front&rdquo; and anti-fascist unity caused the YCL to grow greatly in numbers throughout the 1930s, the heart of such growth located in New York City. At that time, Klieger lived in the South Bronx at 560 Fox Street, and shortly after joining the YCL, he decided to go to Spain to fight in the war, almost certainly emboldened by anti-fascist ideology.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn May 29th, 1937, Klieger sailed on the Britannic to France. Once in France, he boarded the Espolla to Spain, arriving in Albacete on June 16, 1937. Klieger, like many international volunteers after a tough journey, arrived sick and unfit for service in Spain, and was sent to the Huete Hospital, where it is likely that British Medical Mission volunteers took care of him, until he was fit to serve. After recovery, Klieger served with the 35th Division Service Sanitaire, which together with the 11th Division would take part in the Zaragoza Offensive, which was a major attempt by the Republicans to slow down the Nationalist advance in the north. The 35th Division, under the leadership of Juan Modesto, included Soviet-made tanks, as well as cavalry and artillery. Whilst Klieger was sick, the 35th Division took over a town named Codo, fighting against heavy resistance from Carlist troops, and by the time Klieger had joined the fighting, the focus of the 35th Division had shifting to aiding other divisions in attempting to capture Belchite, a town which resisted Republican attacks for months. However, by September 1937, the Republican offensive in the North lost steam, and the 35th Division, likely Klieger with it, withdrew from fighting to regroup after many casualties.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSoon after Belchite, Klieger was once again sick, recovering at American Hospital Villapaz, but this time did not return to the 35th Division. Rather, Klieger snuck off without permission to meet Comrade John Gates, a very highly ranking American Communist political commissar in Albacete to ask personally for repatriation to the USA, and was denied. Such a denial of repatriation is not unexpected for John Gates, who was known as a disciplinarian, who even once controversially decided to execute a deserter named Paul White. Klieger then transferred to the 15th Brigade, serving 17 days at the Teruel front, a grueling defense against the Francoist counterattack, where many divisions suffered extreme casualties against the rebels led by General Antonio Aranda.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter 17 days in Teruel, Klieger was once again hospitalized, and sent this time to the 15th military hospital in Barcelona. After weeks of fierce fighting at Teruel and Belchite, two of the fiercest fronts of the war, noticing large casualties all around, it can only be assumed that Klieger was no longer motivated to fight in the Spanish Civil War. In addition, Klieger&rsquo;s step-father passed away around the same time, leaving his mother alone with two children (a one year old girl and a twelve year old disabled boy). Months earlier in November 1937, John Gates had denied Klieger repatriation to the US based on a medical recommendation from Len Crome, the Chief Medical Officer of the 35th Division, which stated that Klieger was in a &ldquo;highly nervous state and unfit for any work,&rdquo; leading Klieger to fight on with the 15th Division at Teruel. However, after weeks of hospital stay in Barcelona, Klieger was done fighting the war, and entirely deserted during the spring of 1938, boarding a ship in Barcelona, and finding his way back to NYC on the SS Pilcut, alongside fellow deserter Karl Reed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite deserting, the Spanish Civil War did not mark the end of Klieger&rsquo;s military service. He went on to serve in the second World War as a seaman, fighting against fascism yet again, as many Spanish Civil War Volunteers would. Not much is known about his later life until his death on August 10th, 1987 in Brooklyn. Klieger was buried in Mount Carmel Cemetery, a Jewish cemetery in Glendale, Queens County, New York.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Joseph Martin Sinnott was born in New York City on August 12th, 1892. He lived at No. 1 Christopher Street in Greenwich Village. He worked as a mining engineer in New York City. During 1922, he lived abroad in Spain and France, which, in addition to his identity as a person of Jewish descent, might have served as his motivation to volunteer in Spain. He traveled to many places before he went to volunteer for the Spanish Civil War. His travel records indicated he traveled from Antwerp, Belgium to New York with his wife, Alice Sinnott, on the SS Zeeland in August, 1925. He also traveled from Cherbourg, France to New York on the SS Lapland in October-November 1928. Another travel record indicates that he traveled from San Jose, Puerto Rico to New York in September 1931. On March 12, 1937, he was issued a passport, #374461, which he used to travel to Spain to volunteer. During the Spanish Civil War, he served as an aide to Major Allan Johnson at the Estado Mayor (Headquarters) in Albacete. Johnson served as an operations officer and liaison officer, before being wounded at Jarama and assigned to training new volunteers at the Estado Mayor in Tarazona, Albacete. Sinnott likely served non-combatant roles in war and stayed at Estado Mayor to support the Brigades. After spending a year volunteering in the war, he returned on the Champlain from Le Havre, France and landed in New York on July 20th, 1938. There are little to no records about his life after the Spanish Civil War, but some information shows he didn&rsquo;t stop his travel activities, as another travel record indicates Sinnott returning from Reykjavik, Iceland to New York in October, 1955. He is currently buried at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Upstate New York.</p>\r\n    ",

        "data": "<p>George Watt was born Israel Kwatt, a year before the Great War, on November 5, 1913. Living in East Harlem in his youth, he came from a firmly leftist upbringing. His parents were both proud working-class socialists. His father was a silversmith, jeweler, and general metalworker. Though ethnically Jewish, his mother and father were atheists, despite the religious orthodoxy of his grandparents. His paternal grandfather had been a proud socialist as well, being one of the leaders of the first textile strike in their Polish hometown of Lotz. Strikes were illegal under the Czar, so he was arrested, put in chains, and ordered to march back to his native village as an example to the others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watt had joined the Young Communist League in high school, successfully protesting the school&#39;s attempt to raise the meal costs. He attended Brooklyn college in 1931, before transferring to Cooper Union to study Engineering between 1933-1935. He dropped out to become a full time student organizer for the Communist National Student League. It was at that point he changed his name to obscure his Jewish roots, though much later in life he said he regretted that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He recruited others for the war before joining himself. He fought for most of the war and suffered several, luckily non-fatal, injuries. All the while, he continued to write to his wife and many of those letters are preserved in the Tamiment archives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Aragon Offensive, a bullet went clean through his arm and grazed his chest, leaving a lasting scar he would go on to proudly show his children. During the Battle Of Gandesa (1938), the Lincoln battalion and its British counterpart defended a hilltop against the Nationalists. They were surrounded, and communication had gone silent. Countless died. A few, Watt included, escaped by swimming, naked except for berets with their ID cards hidden in them, down the frigid, rapid, and rocky Ebro river. Six drowned, but eight survived. They briefly met Ernest Hemingway and Herbert Mathews, before rejoining the rest of their brigade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watt was once again wounded while serving at Fuentes de Ebro. While recovering, he gave a flag bearing the words &ldquo;American Students Union&rdquo; to the Federal Union of Spanish Students in a gesture of international solidarity. He served at the Ebro Offensive, and during his last 7 months in Spain served as the political commissar of the Lincoln Battalion. One can cynically note none of his actions as a Comintern political commissar were recorded. That being said, as a commisar he was said to have been &quot;dearly loved&quot;, while other commisars were not described so kindly. He was described as &quot;ever youthful&quot;, and would fight while wounded instead of recovering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Ebro retreats, he and his unit were saved by Ralph Wilkinson Wardlaw and another rifleman. The two riflemen were in the rearguard and covered the unit&#39;s retreat, laying down their lives in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon returning, he and his wife Ruth had a son, Daniel Watt. Sadly, Ruth died unexpectedly soon after he was born. George remarried, this time to Margaret, a very close friend of the couple (all three were involved in leftist organizing together).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Margaret loved and treated Daniel like her own son, and it was reciprocated. Eventually, he learned the truth when Ruth&#39;s mother screamed at him that &quot;Margie&quot; was not his real mother. Daniel was upset at first, but still accepted Margie as his mother. If not by blood then by the ties that bind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Daniel was barely two years old, George went on to become a sergeant in the US Air Force during WWII. It was initially very difficult because the U.S government was at first unwilling to allow Spanish Civil War veterans to join, then unwilling to send them into action, for being &ldquo;prematurely anti-fascist&rdquo;. They later changed this policy as they needed more men. Decades later, he wrote a memoir about his experience being shot down in Belgium on his 30th birthday, parachuting out of the plane before making his way back home, then traveling through Franco&rsquo;s Spain, called &ldquo;The Comet Connection: Escape from Hitler&#39;s Europe&rdquo; in 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His whole family, partially representing the Communist Party in alliance with the NAACP, the Labor Party, and the local unions, was involved in protesting the lynching of Charles, Alphonzo, Richard, and Joseph Ferguson, unarmed Black WWII veterans in full uniform, who were shot by a white police officer for attempting to order coffee in a whites only establishment. Sadly, despite all they did, those pigs responsible were never held accountable. This was the psyche that embodied his family, he never stopped instilling his revolutionary spirit in his children, always encouraging them to fight injustice whenever and wherever they could. His family always sang leftist songs together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout his life, he would covertly disappear for weeks to months at a time, carrying out the orders of the communist party. Throughout the Cold War, the FBI wiretapped him. While they never got any conclusive evidence, he later recounted how he helped the Communist party set up underground systems for when the US government would inevitably crack down on them. Gene Dennis, the executive secretary of the Communist party, tasked him with finding places the leadership could hide in Mexico should the time come. So under the pretense of a family vacation, Watt got in contact with a comrade who had been living there, preparing for this very eventuality, and built a secret network of operatives. The plan was that when the leaders were arrested, some chosen reserve leaders would flee and run the party from underground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1951 in &ldquo;Dennis vs. United States&rdquo;, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeals of the Communists convicted in the Smith Act trials. George, along with many who were close to him, including Gil Green, Gus Hall, and Gene Dennis, jumped bail and escaped. George, having fought behind enemy lines in two wars, helped sneak them away into Mexico, then hid there for months. When trying to escort his charges to the safety of the Soviet Union, they were captured in a motel by Mexico City by the Mexican secret police. Gus was extradited to the US, but George remained in hiding in Mexico City, unsure of who the leak was. He was convinced it was a mole deep within the party leadership, which would explain why nobody was willing to blow their cover testifying against him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Margaret went to a safe contact and got in touch, and within three months the Communist Party had arranged his safe return to the US. When he finally got back, his little boy Daniel was already a teenager attending the Bronx High School of Science. George then became an underground organizer in western Pennsylvania, specifically near Pittsburgh, where the bosses were particularly brutal in suppressing working-class organizing. His placement there was partially a punishment for failing to get Gus Hall to safety. During this time he worked with numerous unions and covert Communists, often sending messages in code to help the labor movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this atmosphere he grew suspicious of redecorating going on in an apartment next door, but by then it was too late. The FBI came in guns drawn and arrested him November 4, 1953, just one day before his 40th birthday. His bail was set at $25,000. His lawyers argued it should be released due to his heroism escaping from behind Nazi lines. The prosecution riposted that because he was so good at escaping, the bail should in fact be doubled. Eventually, the bail was reduced to $10,000, which his family financed with a second mortgage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the trial came after two years of waiting, the prosecution sought to prove that being a Communist was inherently violent, citing the Communist Manifesto as well as the writings of Lenin and Stalin, all without context. The defense countered with the revisionist party line that the path to socialism in advanced capitalist states was peaceful, as opposed to the violence necessary to overthrow the feudal system in Russia. Eventually, he was convicted with the testimony of a paid informant (&ldquo;stool pigeon&rdquo; was the term that was used) and supposed longtime family friend, Alexander Wright. George was deeply shaken by this betrayal. This was especially painful considering George served as the party&rsquo;s &ldquo;security officer&rdquo;, identifying FBI agents and informants. Despite this, those on trial continued all the way in general good spirits, with the customary Communist optimism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1958 he split with the party, following his initial disbelief but final acceptance of Khrushchev&#39;s denunciation of Stalin and his revulsion with the Soviet invasion of Hungary. Though the hard-liners had insisted on following Soviet leadership after the revelations, George had initially tried to democratize the party and steer it away from Soviet goals. It was around this time the indictment was finally overturned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having spent nearly all his life as a member of the Communist Party, a professional revolutionary, so to speak, he had no employable skills to speak of. At the unconventional age of 46, he became apprenticed as a journeyman printer by his friends in the industry. Soon after, he went back to Brooklyn College, taking night courses to complete the bachelor&rsquo;s degree he&rsquo;d abandoned so long ago. He went on to graduate in social work, working as an administrator of the Community Mental Health Center in Brooklyn from 1968-1982. He died July, 1994 at the age of 80 due to cancer, survived by his sons, Steven and Daniel, his wife, 4 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>On August 5th, 1912, In Chicago, Illinois, Milton (Moses) Epstein, was born. His father was Jacob Epstein, a Polish immigrant. Milton attended primary school as well as university. After his education, he became a railway and metal worker. In 1929, the stock market collapsed, leading the world into &ldquo;The Great depression.&rdquo; This had an effect everywhere and jobs were hard to come by. In fact, 60% of people were classified as poor by the federal government in 1933 which was abnormally high.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the great depression, the soviet union seemed to be flourishing from an outside perspective. This led a large contingent of people including Milton to turn to communism. This was due to its promise of eliminating the poverty that had been brought upon by the great depression. It appealed especially to people working in factories and on farms which are industries that had taken huge hits during the depression; Milton worked in one of those industries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter becoming a communist, he traveled to Canada and joined the young communist league of Canada in 1933, eventually becoming a section organizer. Organizations such as the Trade Union organization league as well as the Workers Unity league were a part of the young communist league and worked to fight for the pay of workers as well as safe working conditions for industrial workers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring this time, over 1,500 including Milton were recruited from the communist party of Canada for the international brigades to serve in the republican forces during the Spanish civil war. It attracted many communists due to the fight against fascism and for communism by the republican forces against Franco&rsquo;s nationalist regime. In order to fight in the war, he traveled to New York city in order to apply for a passport. In the passport, which was passport #423907, he used the street address of Montgomery street, Brooklyn, New York. He was then able to set sail upon the Statendam to Spain on June 4th, 1937, and went aboard the U.S.S. Statendam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe arrived in Spain on June 22nd, 1937 where he was assigned to the Mackenzie-Papineau battalion, named after 19th-century leaders that contributed to Canada&rsquo;s independence movement. At full-strength, the battalion had around 600 men, mostly consisting of Canadians but also having Americans, Cubans, Spaniards, and a small number of Irish. He was trained in communications and the entire battalion had some of the best and lengthy training any unit had received up to that time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey fought their first battle in October 13th, 1937 in the Zaragoza offensive at Fuentes de Ebro where the aerial bombardment from the fascists was ineffective; but tanks followed which overwhelmed them and ended up costing the battalion its defeat. Despite this, Milton along with others in the Mackenzie-Papineau battalion were cited for bravery.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA battle where the Mackenzie-Papineau battalion was the battle of Teruel which occurred on December 15th, 1937, when the republicans were bombarded with attacks from nationalists but still held their ground, even being mistaken for retreating. They then pushed an offensive and surprised the enemy and ended up being victorious and it ended up giving them the special citation of bravery from the republican army, as well as being held in high regard from military observers in Britain and the United states.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Mackenzie Papineau battalion&#39;s last battle was the Ebro offensive which started on July 25th, 1938. Republican forces crossed the Ebro river to mount an offensive against nationalist forces. They were overwhelmed by fascist forces and were forced to retreat. This was hard and Milton died on July 30th, 1938 Many other members of the Mackenzie-Papineau battalion held off six-tank attacks which permanently stopped the fascist offensive. Many in the battalion died giving their lives holding off fascist forces to buy time for others to retreat and live another day. Milton was one of those who perished in the battle and died on July 30th, 1938. He was 25 years old.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven though Milton may have died young, he truly made an impact on what he cared about and the Abraham Lincoln brigades. He was not only cited for bravery in the war but was a true man of the cause against fascism and died in that pursuit.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Joseph Francis Rehill (also known as Joe and later as Francis Patrick Reel) was born on March 14, 1913 in New Brunswick, New Jersey to John Howard Rehill and Christina Clancy. His family also included his older sister Elizabeth Rehill Kerrigan, younger sister Margaret Rehill, and younger brother John Rehill. Rehill graduated from St. Barnard&rsquo;s Parochial School in New York City before attending Mechanical Institute. After his education, Rehill went on to become a clerk. He joined the Book Keepers, Stenographers and Accountants Union, a union with a substantial group of left-wing activists and sympathizers, including Rehill himself who joined Communist Party in May of 1935. Rehill received a passport on February 2, 1937 which listed his address both as New Brunswick, New Jersey as well as 381 Nye Avenue, Irvington, New York.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrough his association with the Communist Party, Rehill learned that the party was organizing volunteers to join the fight in Spain. As a passionate anti-fascist, he signed up to volunteer as soon as he heard the news. Rehill sailed to Spain aboard the Paris, setting sail on February 6, 1937 where he disguised himself as a tourist in order to not alert law enforcement and get his new passport taken away as then President Theodore&rsquo;s administration threatened. He arrived in Spain on February 15, 1937 after making the difficult trek across the dangerous Pyrenees Mountains after nightfall. This was the only way for an American to get into Spain at the time. Upon arriving, he did very little training for battle; instead his days were filled with instruction in different languages, mostly French, and lengthy communist speeches. Rehill served with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, specifically the Lincoln Battalion in Company 2, Section 2, Group 1.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJust ten days after his arrival, Rehill was sent into the ongoing battle at Jarama, where he would fight until June. Like many others, Rehill&rsquo;s first experience seeing and firing a rifle was on the battlefield. In a diary entry, Rehill wrote that he &ldquo;never knew there were so many bullets in the world, and all of them seem to shoot around me.&rdquo; Heavy losses occurred at the battle of Jarama but the Republican forces were able to successfully hold the Madrid-Valencia road. Rehill was wounded in action and sent south to a hospital in Colmenar, a municipality in Andalusia, for an operation on June 26, 1937. However, the hospital lacked surgical knowledge and Rehill suffered surgical complications so he was sent to the city Murcia for further medical treatment. Rehill was later repatriated to get another operation, arriving back in the United States on October 12, 1937 on the Veendam. He was deeply disappointed about coming home to America, &ldquo;disgusted&rdquo; at his &ldquo;unimpressive homecoming&rdquo; on Columbus Day at Hoboken. He longed to quickly recover and rejoin the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in their fight.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRehill applied to return to Spain in November of 1937 but was turned away after he was told recruiting was closed and even if it wasn&rsquo;t, there were orders to send no veterans back to Spain. While he was greatly disheartened by the news, he still longed to go back to the battlefield and contribute his manpower.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter hearing of improved policy in the army, including better enforcement of discipline, Rehill once again applied to rejoin his old battalion. He had previously disliked the rigid discipline he experienced in the brigade. In April of 1937, during his participation in the fight at Jarama, Rehill was arrested for refusing an inoculation. He thought that this course of action was unjust so these new changes in policy assured Rehill that he would receive better treatment from higher ups if he returned.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHim and friend Joe Gordon returned to Spain once more, Rehill on May 27, 1938 on the Massanet, and Gordon on May 29, 1938 on the Massaneton. What Rehill found in Spain was no longer just a ragtag group of volunteer anti-fascists. The Abraham Lincoln Brigade was composed of survivors, trained men capable of leading and fighting, whether it was on the battlefield in Spain or as workers back home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe was now assigned to the Lincoln-Washington Battalion as Transmissions in Company 1. He served at the Ebro Offensive, a key battle in the Spanish Civil War as the Republicans fought to take control of Catalonia which could have turned the tide in the war by providing valuable infrastructure as well as reconnecting the Republicans in a contiguous landmass. While the Republicans seemed to be winning at the beginning of the battle, the Nationalists eventually overwhelmed the Republicans in a counteroffensive, defeating the Republicans in the end. About a month after the devastating loss, Rehill returned to the United States once more on December 20, 1938 aboard the Ausonia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRehill&rsquo;s hatred for fascism was reignited with the beginning of World War II but it took until March 27, 1941 for Rehill to enlist to join the WWII US Army. He hoped the skills he learned during the time he served under the Abraham Lincoln Brigade would bring down fascism regardless of the unfortunate outcome in Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1944, Rehill married Anne Rudin in New Jersey. He also changed his name to Francis Patrick Reel in the early 1950s, likely to avoid persecution during the era of McCarthyism.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Paul White was born in 1909 in New York City. He spent one year in a New York City high school and two years in the U.S. Army. He then worked on the East Coast waterfront with his friend Joe Bianca and became an official in the Seaman&#39;s Union. He was also a member of the American Communist Party. Upon the outbreak of the coup d&#39;&eacute;tat against the Republic and the Popular Front in 1936, White and his friend Bianca joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade to fight for the Communist Party and against fascism during the Spanish Civil War.<br />\r\nWhite arrived in Spain in May of 1937. He worked under Robert Merrian to organize transporting the Battalion to the Aragon battlefront. In August of 1937, White was sent on a mission to collect the leftover American soldiers in Madrid and bring them to the frontline. White and his partner Edwin Rolfe achieved the near-impossible task and managed to collect full rations and most of the soldiers all within six hour.<br />\r\nAfter the Republic&#39;s defeats in the Argon front, White along with other members of the Brigade left without permission because they claimed that their contracts had expired and they should be allowed to return home. They were arrested and sent back to the frontline, but White stole an automobile to escape towards the French border. White was arrested in Catalonia and David Doran, the brigade commissar at the time, believed White should be executed for desertion. However, Doran was overruled and White was sent back to the frontline.<br />\r\nAfter that incident, White was afraid of fighting in battles again because he felt the Republic was doomed and all the fighting would be futile. In March 1938, White was sent to get supplies and ammunition, but he tried to escape again towards the French border. As White approached the border and saw deserters and troops, his fear grew as he realized that even if he did escape, he would still have to face everyone back home and live under the name of a deserter. At the same time, he heard that his wife had given birth to his son and began to regret what he had done, because he wanted to set a great example for his son and wanted his son to be proud of him. White was arrested soon after in a town near the border, but he viewed it as a way to save him from completely wrecking his life. He then returned to the frontline and confessed his actions. White admitted that his escape to safety would not have protected him from the loss of everything and everyone he loves, and he asks for another chance to serve in his ranks in order to redeem himself and erase this stain on his military record.<br />\r\nIn April, 1938, White was charged with desertion, and his battalion officer John Gates, who was known to be a strict disciplinarian, ordered him to be executed. White&rsquo;s execution was done secretly at night without anyone in the Battalion knowing the detail and reason of it. The next day it was announced that White had been executed as a deserter by the unanimous decision of the battalion, but it was not the case since most of the battalion did know about the execution. This caused huge controversies within the battalion, including White&rsquo;s friend Joe Bianca shouting &ldquo;those sons of bitches!&rdquo; at the commanders. Because of these dissents, it was quickly announced that no further execution would take place within the Abraham Lincoln Battalion. According to John Gates, the day after White&rsquo;s execution, an order came down from the Division to countermand the execution.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Leon Rosenthal was a New Yorker of Jewish descent who enlisted to fight in Spain when he was 26 years old. Little is known about Rosenthal&rsquo;s early life, although he was a registered member of the United Electrical Workers Union, as well as an amateur astronomer. When he left for Spain, he was planning on becoming a scientist upon his return. At the time of his departure, he lived at 380 3rd Ave in Brooklyn, in what is now Park Slope. Funnily enough, where he once lived is now down the block from Battalion Studios, a local recording studio.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    As was common among union members at the time, Rosenthal was most likely a socialist, and certainly a virulent antifascist. However, before he could travel to Spain to fight for what he saw to be a most necessary cause, he had one bureaucratic obstacle to overcome - obtaining a passport. Rosenthal got his passport in late April 1937 and set sail for Spain aboard the Aquitania on May 12th, 1937. Once he arrived, it was not long before he would be put into action on the front.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Most of what is known about Rosenthal can be gleaned from letters he wrote to his wife, Lee, which detail his day-to-day activities, as well as his hopes of defeating fascism and returning home again to &ldquo;start a brand new romance together&rdquo; with his wife, who also volunteered to help the Republic from her home in Brooklyn. These letters have additional historical significance as Rosenthal&rsquo;s descriptions of his experiences working in a Republican propaganda sound truck are thought to be the first of their kind.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Rosenthal&rsquo;s work in the propaganda truck involved printing and distributing leaflets, as well as driving right up to the front and going through a full propaganda campaign with speakers to attract fascist deserters. Him and two others ran the truck, but they were assisted by former deserters and other Spaniards who made speeches throughout the night. The nightly broadcast would start with a playing of the Spanish national anthem, Himno de Riego, followed by a speech by a poet or some other young intellectual updating the whole front on the latest news and speaking of the politics behind the war. After that, the microphone would be handed to a fascist deserter, who would try to convince his comrades to follow him by talking about how much better he was treated on the Republican side. The broadcast would finish with a playing of the Internationale. This tactic was extremely effective, with Rosenthal noting that his team was able to attract 20 fascist deserters in one particularly strong night of work.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Rosenthal&rsquo;s unique line of work made him different from most of his fellow American volunteers, and in fact he was rarely (if ever) actually with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. His truck was itself an independent unit under the 45th Battalion. In August and September of 1937, Rosenthal spent time on the Zaragoza front with the Polish Dombrowski Battalion as well as briefly spending some time with the Italian Garibaldi Brigade.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    After working on the Zaragoza front, Rosenthal and his truck moved to the Extremadura Front. It was there, on February 27th, 1938, that Rosenthal&rsquo;s truck was unfortunately hit with a bomb from a fascist plane. Only one picture of Rosenthal survives today. Interestingly enough, this picture has also been attributed to another Leon Rosenthal, a American volunteer from Los Angeles who served in the Canadian Mackenzie Papineau Battalion under the name Carl Nitzberg. However, per the official archives of the Abraham Lincoln Brigades, the photograph in question is of the Rosenthal described above.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Leon Rosenthal never did achieve his dream of becoming a scientist. Like so many others of his time, the evils of fascism cut his life tragically short. However, he sacrificed his life for a cause that he truly believed in, and that is an honor that very few can claim.</p>\r\n    ",

        "data": "<p>John Wegrzynek was born in a small town called Iskrzynia in southern Poland, on October 20th, 1901 to Stanislaw and Marianna Wegrzynek. He sailed to the US along with his parents and his sibling aboard the SS Vanderland from Antwerp, Belgium. Upon arrival, his family stayed with relatives in Buffalo, New York and became naturalized (receiving Passport #372703). Much like other Poles during the time in industrial cities, he was attracted to metalworking and he remained in the trade for much of his 20&rsquo;s and early 30&rsquo;s. This job provided him with financial security, allowing him to move to New York City where he resided at 239 E 13th Street in Manhattan. In 1937, he registered under the Communist Party, placing him on various watchlists in the US government. Upon enlisting in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (in the &ldquo;terra corps&rdquo;), he immediately became a point of interest in the eyes of intelligence agencies who reported on the ties between the Communists and the XV Brigade. In the purest version of McCarthy-ism, just like many of his fellow Communist Party members, he was suspected of forging documents and espionage by the Special Committee on Un-American Activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At 36 years of age, Wegrzynek set sail to Spain on March 18th, 1937 aboard the Normandie. Along with numerous other Polish volunteers, he arrived on April 2nd. Little is known about his time in Spain, however, as there are practically no records of him serving shoulder to shoulder with the XV Brigade, it is likely that he served in the Palafox Battalion (a part of the larger Dabrowski Brigade) much like many other Poles in his timeframe there. On a short slip of paper, he was described in Spanish by his peers as being &ldquo;...very well developed politically&hellip;&rdquo; and &ldquo;...very active.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After serving in Spain for a year and three months, he returned to New York City aboard the Champlain on July 20th, 1938. Nothing is known about his activity in the U.S. after his deployment. He did not join any veterans&rsquo; associations, unions, nor did he participate in any censuses or get married. He is survived by his niece, who recognized his face in an identification effort on a forum.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Leon Rosenberg, or Leo as he liked to be called, was born on June 26, 1910 in New York City to Jewish parents. His address is listed as 425 East 6th Street, NYC, located in the East Village. This is not surprising as the East Village became an ethnic enclave for Jewish people in the turn of the 20th century. The East Village used to be an ethnic enclave for German people, but it became dominated by Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. The influx of Jewish immigrants in the late 1800s to the early 1920s was due to the assassination of Tsar Alexander II, which Jews were scapegoated for, so they fled to the United States and sought freedom from persecution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLittle is known about his parents or family, but his parents were likely Communist, which inspired him to become Communist. He worked as a journalist and was affiliated with the American Federation of Government Employees, which was associated with the American Federation of Labor. Not much is known about the specific reasons he went to fight in the Spanish Civil War, but like many other volunteers, he wanted to fight fascism and stop the Nationalists from taking over Spain. He left his wife and family on March 10, 1937, aboard the Washington, and arrived in Albacete alongside other members of the 15th International Brigade on March 27, 1937.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRosenberg was a member of the Washington Battalion, whose first initiation as a fighting unit was the Brunete Offensive. Rosenberg&rsquo;s first battle, however, was the Battle of Jarama, so it is likely that he was first part of the Lincoln Battalion, and then reassigned to the Washington Battalion, due to strategic needs. The Battle of Jarama (February 6 - February 27, 1937), was the first major battle in the war, in which Franco tried to capture Madrid by dislodging Republican lines at the Jarama River. Although the Nationalists did not end up capturing Madrid, they managed to gain some ground. The Republicans were able to defend the Jarama River, but they suffered heavy casualties, as did the Nationalists. Rosenberg attributed the failure of the Battle of Jarama to a commanding general&rsquo;s stubbornness, who sent the soldiers to attack a heavily fortified enemy position without proper support from planes, tanks and artillery. The next battle Rosenberg fought in was the Brunete Offensive (July 6 - July 25, 1937), the first military action for the men in the Washington Battalion. Their plan was to capture the town of Villanueva de la Canada by softening the town&rsquo;s defenses with artillery and aerial bombardment. As Rosenberg notes in a journal entry he wrote, he was paralyzed with fear when he heard gunfire right above his head. However, as the true fighter he was, he didn&rsquo;t let this control him; He faced the danger of getting shot head-on, and let his love of freedom control his actions. Gunfire intensified at Brunete, and he and other volunteers continued to fight, until they had to find cover behind some stones. Rosenberg didn&rsquo;t give up; He knew many of his friends had died, so he fought hard for them, and eventually the Republicans were able to capture the town of Villanueva de la Canada. Rosenberg later found out that the original plan was not to attack the town, but go around it and capture territory the Nationalists had left behind. He was understandably frustrated as this would&rsquo;ve saved many lives, time, and resources. The Lincoln and Washington Battalion continued to suffer casualties in the Brunete Offensive, and Rosenberg attributed this to the incredible heat, thirst and incessant bombing. Rosenberg also noted that he had become attached to other soldiers; They had become a family and the death of comrades was personal. It was during the Brunete Offensive that the Lincoln and Washington Battalions had merged, after over half of the men died. Although the Brunete Offensive was a loss for the Republicans, it made the soldiers more knowledgeable and experienced. The Spanish praised the soldiers for their heroic efforts, but in Rosenberg&rsquo;s eyes, he didn&rsquo;t think of himself as a hero; He thought of himself as someone who was doing his duty to fight fascism. He also fought in the Battle of Teruel (December 1937 - February 1938), joining a Czech anti-aircraft battery as a replacement for men who had died.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough Rosenberg had been a brave soldier, he was involved in minor controversies. On December 22, 1937, he was kicked out of the officer training school for being too individualistic and having a negative attitude. He tried to get his superiors to change the decision and let him stay in the school, to no avail. This situation made him realize that he needed to change himself, therefore he tried to start anew by requesting to handle artillery on a field. Eventually, he joined the 4th Artillery Group and trained at Almansa, the training base for the International Artillery. Rosenberg was also in P.O., which is unclear what it means, but he was accused of being a troublemaker and acting suspiciously in the front lines. He was also advised not to be permitted to handle mail. This, coupled with the dismissal from the officer training school, allowed the promise of repatriation to fall through. However, he eventually returned to the US on February 4, 1938 aboard the President Harding and died on January 17, 1997, Hallandale, Florida.</p>\r\n",

In January 1937, he joined the Communist Party of the United States of America. On May 27, 1937, Jesse received passport #426878, which listed his address as 281 West 102nd Street in the Upper West Side. On June 2, 1937, he sailed across the Atlantic aboard the Aquitania. On June 20, 1937, he was arrested by the French aviso Granit near Port-Vendres, but was later released. He arrived in Spain via Massanet on June 22, 1937.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Spain, he served in the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, of which he was sergeant and secretary. The Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, or the Mac-Paps, was a Canadian battalion that fought as part of the XV International Brigade (the Abraham Lincoln Brigade) during the Spanish Civil War. The Battalion was named after William Lyon Mackenzie and Louis-Joseph Papineau, two Canadian politicians who led a rebellion in Canada one century prior, in 1837-38. Although the battalion was nominally Canadian, it had more volunteers from the USA than from Canada.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJesse&rsquo;s first battle was at Fuentes de Ebro. He fought in The Battle of Teruel, which was one of the bloodiest actions of the war, and involved heavy artillery and aerial bombardment. The result of the battle was the conquest of Teruel by Franco&rsquo;s Nationalist forces. Jesse then participated in the Great Retreats, or the Aragon Offensive. In this offensive, Franco&rsquo;s forces smashed through the Republican lines, after the Republican Army had been weakened at Teruel. The Republican Army was forced to retreat, and the Nationalists made it all the way south to the Mediterranean coast. Wallach was also involved in the Battle of the Ebro, the most significant battle of the war and the largest battle ever fought on Spanish soil. The battle was disastrous for the Republic, severely weakening the army and destroying the Republican Air Force.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere exists an anecdote about Jesse in the memoir of Abe Smorodin, a soldier in the same battalion as Jesse. Smorodin wrote that as the soldiers huddled together to stay warm in the chill of an Aragon winter, Jesse claimed that he dreamt nightly of neon-lit diner signs flashing the word EAT.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJesse Wallach also appears in the diaries of Robert Hale Merriman. Merriman was a doctoral student at the University of California, Berkeley, who fought with the Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War. Meriman&#39;s ROTC experience led him to become the leader of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in January 1937. According to the diaries of Merriman, in June of 1937, Wallach was sent to officer&rsquo;s school in Pozo Rubio. At some point during his training at the officers school, Jesse Wallach was reprimanded for spreading rumors. Merriman wrote about a Comintern policy to save cadres, to not have all communist party men killed in action. According to Merriman, after the creation of this policy, Jesse Wallach &ldquo;requested a safe job&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJesse returned to the US on December 20, 1938 aboard the Ausonia. After the Spanish Civil War, Jesse also fought in WWII, and was a tireless worker for social justice. He married the pianist Lucy Brown, and later had a second wife Clara. Jesse died in New York City on January 20, 1999.</p>\r\n",

Salaria, on the other hand, was taken to her mother&rsquo;s father, a Caucasian man named Samuel Moses III, living in Akron, Ohio. He was the one who set up Salaria with her foster family, the Jacksons, when she was three years old. Her foster mother was a schoolteacher who had to travel to Kentucky to teach due to race restrictions on teaching in their hometown, which was a prelude to the kind of racial restrictions Salaria would face in her life as a result of the profession she would eventually pursue. Salaria was mostly taken care of by her foster father and grandmother, who owned a grocery store in town, but she went on to live with another family, the Harris Family, whose mother was also a schoolteacher. With the amount of school teachers in her life, Salaria at a young age wanted to be a schoolteacher, not knowing her destiny lay far beyond the borders of her hometown&rsquo;s school system. When her oldest brother, Andrew, got married, he moved to Akron as well to support his little sister, and she moved in with him at his new home on Scott Avenue and Livingston Place, living with a close family member for the first time since her parents&rsquo; deaths. Because of her change in residence, she was allowed to transfer from Central High School in Akron to West High School, a major step up for her due to the former school prohibiting her participation in athletics as a result of her race. She was able to graduate from West High School as a well-known athlete and student, known in school as &ldquo;Rodeo&rdquo; and &ldquo;SubKee&rdquo;. These were nicknames she earned as a result of her athletic prowess, which apparently allowed her to substitute in any sport, including baseball and volleyball. She was also valedictorian of her high school in 1930, and by that time she had decided to be a nurse as opposed to a school teacher, having gotten a job with a man named Dr. Riddle when she was fifteen years old. At this job, she worked in his office after school and on Saturdays, and during the summer she would unlock his office every day at 8am, scheduling appointments and taking calls on his behalf. Thanks to this job, she learned how to take a pulse, temperature, respiration measurements and such, studying under his wing for the entire time she worked there. She also learned about anatomy on a fake skeleton in his office with removable parts, where she would teach herself the anatomy of the human body. This job impacted her life so much and so quickly, she even decided to take Latin all 4 years of high school, because she realized there was so much Latin in medicine, having a background on the language could further improve her learning capabilities in the subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After graduation, Salaria made the decision to apply to nursing school, but all three nursing schools in her region denied her entry because of her race. So, her brother took the refusal letters she had received from the three schools and gave them to a woman named Mrs. Fristone, who sent the letters to Mrs. Roosevelt, wife of the Governor of New York at the time, Franklin D. Roosevelt. She replied (not directly to Salaria, however), and soon enough, two coordinators were sent out to Akron to interview Salaria, one of which being Mrs. Estelle Massey Osborn, a prominent nurse battling discrimination in the nursing world. After her interview, Salaria was sent a letter from New York&rsquo;s Department of Hospitals, stating that she had to go to Columbus, Ohio to take the entrance exam to enter the schools in New York. Soon enough, she was accepted and was to attend school at Bellevue Hospital, the Mother School of the Harlem Hospital School of Nursing. Here, she obtained a college degree, and she was actively involved in the racial integration of the hospital&rsquo;s dining room during her time there. Her activeness against racial discrimination showed its true colors during her time in New York City, with her joining organizations like the NAACP, furthering her involvement in the civil rights movement while going through her education. After graduating in 1934, she began work at Sea View Hospital at the No-Return Unit for tuberculosis patients. At that time, out of the 26 hospitals that New York City owned, black nurses could only work in 4: Sea View, Harlem Hospital, Metropolitan, and Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. Working at Sea View, blacks were only allowed to work with tuberculosis patients, as there was great risk of infection working with these patients and white nurses and doctors saw this duty as too risky for them to partake in. White doctors never even entered the floor with the terminal cases, giving orders and instructions and receiving reports about patients in the Nursing Office only. Salaria was lucky enough to never have gotten the disease, unlike many of her previous classmates, who died as a result of exposure to the terminal patients. Lucky her; Salaria only weighed 97 pounds when she was in the unit, and catching the disease would surely have been a death sentence.There was an organization at the time fighting against having black nurses serving only in the tuberculosis units in New York City. A meeting was held with the leaders of the Department of Hospitals in New York City, a meeting which Salaria attended, listening to the discussion of the reasons for limiting the colored nurses to these 4 hospitals. The President of all the hospitals made a speech at this large meeting, stating that the reasons for these limitations was that, in twenty years, there wouldn&rsquo;t be a colored problem in the United States anymore, because they will all be dead of tuberculosis. The room went dead silent, but Salaria, 24 years old at the time, stood up, holding up her head, and shouting to the President directly &ldquo;And you are trying to make the dead lie [down].&rdquo; The next day at Sea View, after she spoke at the Department of Hospital meeting, a doctor came in and removed her from the tuberculosis unit and put her in the employee&rsquo;s clinic, and she never worked in the tuberculosis unit again. In 1936, she went to work at Harlem Hospital, the place she had learned nursing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kea&rsquo;s activism continued, as she collected money and medical supplies for a seventy-five bed field hospital for those suffering at the hands of Mussolini during his war against Ethiopia. Being in New York, she began to be influenced by left-wing groups and joined the Communist Party in 1935. At the end of 1936, while Salaria was still at Harlem, she heard about a flood that had affected parts of Ohio and Kentucky, and a bulletin board in her hospital was asking for volunteer medical personnel as members of the Red Cross. Salaria took the day off with some fellow English nurses to go and secure a spot as a volunteer; however, she was rejected once again on account of her race. Fortunately, the doctors who had gone to volunteer with her not only demanded a written statement that could support Red Cross&rsquo;s rejection of Salaria, but a French doctor working at the hospital at the time took the statement to the French Embassy in New York. She was called down to the embassy, and instead of eventually being told she could work on the flood case in Ohio, she was accepted to go to France in February of 1937 with a medical unit to serve in Spain. By March 15th she had passed all tests and examinations required of volunteers in Spain, and resigned from Harlem hospital to leave for her new job across the Atlantic. She left New York on March 27, 1937, as part of the 3rd group of doctors and nurses from America going to Spain to serve in the Spanish Civil War as part of the AMB, the American Medical Bureau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the beginning of Salaria&rsquo;s travels to Spain, she sat with 12 nurses and doctors, and it was clear to her that she was the only black person in the group. The head doctor, Dr. Pitts, who was in charge of the medical unit, made a scene about her being there and sitting at his table for lunch. Doctors and nurses aren&rsquo;t allowed to sit down until the head doctor does, but he refused to sit down because of Salaria, screaming to the waiter &ldquo;I have never sat at a table with a n***er wench and I&rsquo;m not gonna start now.&rdquo; The captain, who was French, along with one of the owners of the shipping line, were brought down to resolve the &ldquo;issue,&rdquo; but instead he offered Kea a first-class seat on the ship, and she roomed with the owner of the shipping line the rest of the way to France, not seeing her medical unit again until they got off the ship. She landed in France on April 3rd in the Mediterranean water of Port Bou, Gerona. When she got off the French ship, many French people took her in, and she and her roommate, who was a journalist, were featured on a postcard that went all over France and Spain. She lived in a top hotel in France until it was time to go to Spain, leaving for Spain a little while after the original American nurses and doctors she had travelled with had gone. Traveling with the reporter and the French group of doctors and nurses to the International Medical Unit, she was stationed at the hospital set up at Villa Paz, one of King Alfonso&rsquo;s summer homes. When she arrived at &ldquo;Hospital Americano No. 1&rdquo;she found she had support from all the nurses and doctors there, since they were all from the North, unlike Dr. Pitts, the Head Doctor, who was actually from the South. Many of the doctors were actually from New York, so she was familiar with some of the people she was surrounded by. Salaria, a surgical nurse, was the only black nurse of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. A result, she gained popularity very quickly, even featuring for a few seconds in two renowned propaganda documentaries in support of the Republic: Heart of Spain directed by Herbert Kline (1937), and Victoire de la vie (Return to Life) directed by Henri Carier Bresson and Herbert Kline (1937). Kea was also married to her husband, Irish brigadier John P. O&rsquo;Reilly, in a civil wedding in 1937.After working at the Villa Paz hospital for 4-5 months, Salaria was transferred to the Mobile Hospital Unit. She was sent to various areas where bombings had occurred, and her job consisted of picking up dead bodies and burying them, as well as helping the wounded. After treating the wounded, they were sent off to the hospital, and she continued on with her Mobile Unit. She went back to the hospital occasionally, only until she was sent to another place. At many of these war-torn villages, Salaria found nothing but children, with 50 to 100 in one place without any parents, as young as 2 years old. Salaria recounts being taken by the young children down to a brook to eat frogs, and seeing them use slingshots to shoot birds. The children also knew the correct plants to eat, which was how they survived until the nurses gave them proper food. Other villages had older people and many wounded civilians, with multiple international doctors assessing and diagnosing patients, including some Indian doctors. One time, her unit went to a cave, which is something Salaria had never been in before. She found a lot of space, and two cords; one red one which led you in, and a green cord which led you out. There were a lot of blankets without beds, some mattresses on the floor, and the floor was all sand. The first night, all Salaria had was her cape and a blanket she had been given to sleep on (she was given a mattress the next night). She was to help feed and take care of the children and make sure they stayed as healthy as possible. Some people she found during her time with the unit were so wounded they couldn&#39;t move and had to be treated on sight until they were well enough to be carried to a nearby hospital. When she was sent to the Front Lines, with her unit, she remembers being on a hill with the enemies, who were on the other side from her position. She says the enemies used to throw over grenades, and she could only watch as numerous comrades of hers got wounded or were killed. She had to pick them up and bring them down as it kept happening. The soldiers were taken care of in the Mobile Unit, and the cycle continued for a very long time, ending only when the fighting on that hill died down. The unit took their wounded to the closest hospital they could find, which was far because she was stationed in the North at the time, meanwhile the South was where most of their hospitals were stationed. There are two stories about her getting separated from her medical unit during the Spanish Civil War, both of which involve her disgruntled superior, Dr. Pitts. In her first account, she was in the front ambulance with Dr. Pitts, coming from Northern Spain back down South because the Fascists were moving down, so they were assisting a village holding a massive evacuation. According to Salaria, there were so many people and possessions coming out of the village, with animals and supplies tied onto citizens escaping, that it looked like a march. While driving, Dr. Pitts told Salaria to go down the line and make sure everyone that was exiting the village was in line. Salaria had to walk all the way down the hoard of people to make sure everyone from the village was where they were supposed to be, and when she had done that she made her way back towards the ambulance. However, she never found the ambulance, having been abandoned by the Unit (accidentally or not, she still doesn&rsquo;t know).This was the first time she had ever gotten lost in Spain, and she walked and walked until around 12am, in March 1938. She was in a patch of woods all alone, deciding to lay down and fall asleep, awakened by a dog who patted her with his paw. She got up, and began following the dog down the hill, when all of a sudden, she spotted a priest with a hoard of sheep so large she thought it was Christ. The dog with Salaria barked at the priest, who bid Salaria to come down the hill with him. He asked her if she was Salaria Kea, to which she replied yes, wondering how the man knew her name. In response, he pulled out the same postcard with the French journalist and her that had been sent all over France when she had arrived in Europe. She told the priest what had happened to her, and the priest said he knew where her group was, and that the dog that had found her would lead her to a bridge across the Ebro River, where someone would meet her on the other side and take her to her station. The priest gave her something to eat, and she was kissed goodbye before walking half a day to the bridge, only to find that it had been blown up. She was planning to swim across the river, telling the dog to stay on the other side while she swam across and keep watch, when all of a sudden she heard a German accent from across the river. She got behind a tree to inspect the people who had spoken, but she saw men dressed in grey, which to her relief meant they were on her side. She finally revealed herself from the bushes, and the man who was previously speaking German greeted her in English, telling her how they had come to retrieve her and bring her from across the river back to her hospital. While one of the men prepared to swim to get Salaria, she brushed them off and told them she could swim just fine. She was greeted on the other side by a larger group of men with guns with orders to retrieve Salaria for her medical unit. She was taken on an ambulance truck back to a hospital where she then worked for a couple of weeks. Funnily enough, Dr. Pitts was there too, but instead of making a big deal of what had happened, Salaria never said a word about it to him, never believing that it had been done on purpose. Salaria&rsquo;s second story was closer to the end of the war, when Salaria and her team were far up North again, and she found herself traveling yet again with Dr. Pitts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were in a different part of Spain than before, stopping at various villages to pick up the sick and wounded, never staying more than a couple of days at one place. One time, they stopped at a huge building, where a loud scream and a child crying inside was heard. She was told by Dr. Pitts to bring whomever was inside with her back to the ambulance, and she went inside to find the people responsible for the sound. She called in Spanish for someone, but didn&rsquo;t get a single reply, waiting for some time before heading back outside. However, when she went back out, everything, including her ambulance, was gone. So, she did the only thing she could do; she began to walk, walking until she thought she heard a car coming for her. She then stepped on the side of the road, waiting, but what she saw coming down the road was not a familiar vehicle, but a huge black car, with German Fascist soldiers dressed in their uniforms. Salaria ran as the soldiers began to shoot at her, swerving through trees until one shot banged a branch off a tree and hit Salaria in the head. Two German soldiers rushed up to her, speaking in German, which Salaria couldn&rsquo;t understand. She was picked up and brought back to the car, being forced to walk outside, with the car driving right beside her. She was planning to fake a fall when they got to a certain point, and act like she couldn&rsquo;t get up, but before that happened, Salaria fell accidentally. Because of that, she was seated right next to the driver of the car, who drove her all the way to a huge building that would be her prison. She was situated 5 flights underground, and in that prison she was left alone with cement bunks and no windows to the outside. Every couple of days the guards would bring her a coconut shell filled with soupy rice that she would have to eat to stay alive. The door had a window with bars where food could be slipped through, and one Spaniard woman used to slip Salaria cookies and bread. The whole time she was there, Salaria wore the same clothes and studied the Bible, having been given it 3 days after her imprisonment by the Spaniard woman at the prison so as to not lose her sanity. One early morning, Salaria was taken to look outside a window on the first flight above the ground, where she saw a tall grey wall. Men, women, and children of all ages were lined up, and she noted how some women were pregnant, and they were lined up in-between German soldiers with guns, 12 on either side. Salaria watched as the Germans outside were given the order to fire, and they shot the citizens who dropped to the floor like flies. There were some relatives of these people forced to watch the same way Salaria was, who screamed at the sight, but were then forced to dispose of the bodies, wash the blood off the walls and do other basic cleanup tasks after the firing squad finished. Salaria was led back to her prison, being told by the soldiers that tomorrow could be her day to be one of those unlucky people who found themselves in-between German gunners.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was a POW for seven weeks, she estimates, and at the end of those seven weeks, after having been brought up two or three times to witness various firing squads shoot at people, she was told that tomorrow was indeed her turn to face the firing squad. However, at 2am the night before that fateful day, someone called for her through the only door leading outside, having brought down her bags and things for her. The person who opened the door was a monk, who brought Salaria up four flights of stairs and outside to a ravine, where they ran into an Englishman with a flashlight, who led them further down. Later they ran into a Canadian, who led them even further down to a wooded area where, through the trees was a train waiting for her. Salaria was put into a crowded coach, where a man who called her by her name bid her to sit down amongst a packed car of confused people, and he handed her a bag with raw eggs, which she ate out of pure hunger. There were chickens, ducks, pigs, and all sorts of fowl on the train along with the passengers, so there was little to no room for anyone on board to be comfortable. She notes how she never saw the monk, the Englishman, or the Canadian ever again, and can&rsquo;t remember their names.It was late 1938 by this time, and by 1 o&rsquo;clock the next day, the train stopped and the passengers were told they could get off. At a restaurant on the hill, Salaria and a group of people went to grab lunch, and decided to eat and relax in a small forest nearby. However, as they were heading up there, Salaria heard planes coming over, and she and the others ran back down the hill to one of many ditches that were dug in the area to hide. She was able to grab a little girl into the trench before a bomb went off some ten feet away. She also told of a doctor, whose wife had been in the train to have a baby in France in a few weeks, but who died as a result of the planes firing on most of the passengers of the train, who were sitting outside their coaches eating lunch. The doctor was said to have wandered aimlessly after the shooting was over, until someone got a hold of him and cleaned the blood off of his non-wounded body. Despite being full before, 6 coaches were empty now as a result of the amount of people who died, which left room for the wounded to board and be treated on the train. After some time, Salaria found herself on the border of France, and stayed for three to four weeks in a hotel. She was then taken on a boat to France, and was greeted by four nuns, who took Salaria to their convent, where she was blessed by the priest and treated by the resident doctor, given food and allowed to rest. For four days, Salaria stayed in bed, and when she was finally able to get up she was taken to Lourdes. She was there for one week, and after that she was taken back down to the convent, where she stayed for some time. There was a young couple living down the hill from the convent, who would take Salaria after breakfast every morning to play tennis and go places, picking flowers for the convent and such. From there, Salaria went to Paris, where she stayed until she was taken home by the British Ship, the Queen Mary, arriving in New York in January 1939. When arriving back home, Salaria toured New York City, lecturing about her experiences during the Spanish Civil War at different Catholic schools, churches and nursing schools. The NAACP, the Urban League, Girl Scouts, Nurses Association, and other organizations reached out to her to hear about her experience and wanted her to share them. To incentivise her, she never paid a dime for her housing accommodations near the different areas she would speak in. She also worked hard to be able to get her husband to immigrate to the United States, as he was a citizen of a European country, a process made doubly difficult by the face that she and her husband were an interracial couple. Time in war didn&rsquo;t end for Salaria with the Spanish Civil War, either: even though Salaria succeeded in getting her husband&rsquo;s immigration status approved (he moved to the US in 1940), he was soon drafted for World War II. Salaria served as well, beginning in 1944 when African-American women were first recruited.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the war, the couple was able to return to New York, and Salaria went on to coordinate staff desegregation in several hospitals. Salaria returned to Akron only a couple of times before retirement, going on stretches as long as 8 years long without visiting her hometown. She lived in New York City until 1973. Despite her many accomplishments and high regard from the members of the Brigade, coming back home to Akron, she was still faced with the discrimination from which she left. Firstly, like many International Brigades volunteers, Salaria&rsquo;s ties to Communism and to the Spanish Republicans hurt her job prospects upon her return to the United States. There was also trouble with her religious practices, a conflict she thought might have been resolved by the time she left for New York City.As a child, Salaria had belonged to the Catholic church; her father was a Catholic and her mother was a Methodist. However, when she was growing up, Salaria couldn&rsquo;t go to Catholic churches in Akron due to racial restrictions, so she went to a range of different Christian churches, from Presbyterian to Baptists to Methodist. One of her relatives, who was pale in skin color, was allowed to attend th Catholic church, but her own husband couldn&rsquo;t because he was black. When she moved back to Akron after retirement, she was told by relatives and friends who brought her to various churches that they had friends in the Catholic Church who could bring her to ones she could attend. However, from August 1973 to East Week in 1974, no one ever came to tell her where she could go to Catholic Church. In 1974, on Ash Wednesday, on Grant Street and Brown was a small Hungarian Catholic Church that Salaria decided to visit to see if she could attend service there. However, the woman at the door screamed at her, asking her what she wanted and telling her to get out, saying no black people could enter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salaria stated many times how her time in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade was the happiest of her life, because that was the one place she was treated as an equal, where her skill mattered more than her race. She died May 18, 1990. One interesting fact about Salaria&rsquo;s accounts of the war is that they sometimes differ with each account. For this reason, Salaria has been accused of &ldquo;self-aggrandizing&rdquo; her memoirs for the sake of publicity and to support the civil rights cause with her stories, due to different accounts even with her early life and her parents. She has recorded giving two different accounts for her father&rsquo;s death; one with him being stabbed to death by an asylum patient while working as a gardener at the Ohio State Hospital for the Insane in Columbus, and one with him working as a seaman during World War I, with his ship blown up at sea. So, when reading her story and her experience, it&rsquo;s important to understand that Salaria was going up against resistance throughout her entire life. With the possibility that her stories were embellished, remember that no matter what, the battles she was fighting because of her race were real, and her accounts, however true they may be, ring well with the hardships she had to deal with as a result of her skin color.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>LeRoy Collins was born on September 2nd, 1899 in Danbury, Connecticut to Jacob and Anna Williams Collins. Not much is known about his early life other than the fact that he was college-educated and was a journalist for a short period of time. However, Collins had a long history of military service and was clearly dedicated to supporting his country and the fight against fascism. When the war was declared in 1914, Collins and thousands of other African-Americans enlisted in the military. Because black people were still barred from the marines and could only serve lowly positions in the navy, Collins served as a mess attendant in the Navy. His work did not stop there though, as and prior to leaving for Spain, he gained a total of eighteen years of military service, mostly in the ary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLater, as a result of Mussolini&rsquo;s invasion of Ethiopia in 1935, Collins joined the Communist Party along with many other African Americans. Being the only country besides Liberia to have never been colonized, this invasion sparked uproars in America, particularly in New York City. Before leaving for Spain though, Collins married Florence McClain Montgomery on July 21st, 1936 in Manhattan. Only after a year of marriage though, Collins left for Spain aboard the SS President Harding on August 18th, 1937. His passport, which he had only received about a month before leaving indicated that he lived on 272 Manhattan Avenue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter arriving in Spain on September 24th, Collins fought in the XV International Brigade. During his time in Spain, Collins was placed under suspicion by his superiors. According to Spanish military records, Collins was seen as untrustworthy and was considered a &ldquo;bad element&rdquo;. He wasn&rsquo;t given positions with a lot of responsibility due to suspicion regarding material Spanish officials had on him, and officials were informed to disregard information he passed on. Reports in his files also marked him as being under observation for political reasons. He was even listed on the &ldquo;Political Suspect and Bad Elements List&rdquo; as being a &ldquo;stool&rdquo; in the WPA union in the United States. Unfortunately, not much information exists to explain these suspicions. He fought in Spain for about a year until he was severely wounded at Fuentes de Ebro on October 17th. One of the bloodiest battles of the war as well as the republic&rsquo;s largest offensive cost Collins the ability to keep fighting. However, after a long recovery, he was released and assigned to Benicassim Hospital in Castello as the postmaster. After a few months, Collins began his return to New York. He left from Lehavre, France aboard the Manhattan on July 28th, and returned to New York on August 4th.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCollins returned to Manhattan to live with his wife for many years before dying on July 14th, 1968. He is currently buried at Military Graveyard on Long Island.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Matylda Jankovic was born on March 14, 1911 in New York to a Polish American and Jewish family. Not much is known about her childhood, but she likely was educated and raised in New York.<br />\r\nJankovic was living in Longwood, a dense neighborhood in southeast Bronx largely populated with Jewish European immigrants in the mid 20th century, before she left for Spain. She became a member of the North American Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy, a communist-affiliated organization dedicated to sending relief to Republican Spain during the war. She became a nurse and joined the American Medical Bureau, an independent association of American doctors and nurses who supported Spanish democracy. Ernest Hemingway notably organized a group of celebrities such as Joan Crawford to fundraise for the AMB, and by the time groups left for Spain they were among the best equipped medical groups in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOn March 18, 1937, Jankovic joined the second American group to board the Normandie and set sail for France. On the ship with her was Dr. John Posner, the famous New York ENT surgeon, as well as Dr. Abraham Friedman and the nurse Rebecca Schulman, who later worked with Jankovic at Villa Paz. Jankovic was among a group of young Jews, specifically Polish Jews, who made up a large proportion of the International Brigades. According to some estimates, up to 70% of the medical personnel volunteers in the brigade were Jewish, and it is likely that Jankovic joined the ranks of Jewish Americans who saw the movement as a way to fight back against fascism and oppression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter arriving in France, the group was driven to Spain in an ambulance by Victor Hirschfield, a fellow New Yorker. From there, Jankovic worked with the Republican Medical Service in Villa Paz, Benicassim, and Pozoblanco. Jankovic worked at multiple hospitals as a nurse, including the American Hospital of Villa Paz, the Czech Hospital of Benicassim, and the Jan Amos Komensky Hospital, where she served as head nurse. She was described by subordinates and patients as strong and brave, and acted as an interpreter for the surgical team of Dr. Joseph Masson, the Medical Captain of the XIII Brigade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nLater, the Jan Komensky Hospital was evacuated from Benicassim to Matar&oacute;, Catalonia, and over the course of the war was moved again further north to Vic as the nationalist front advanced. It is unknown if Jankovic was still working there or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June 1938, after fifteen months in Spain, Jankovic returned to the US. She married Czeslaw Tadler, a decorated Polish soldier and active Communist. Tadler was a member of multiple communist parties in Warsaw and worked at a Polish automobile manufacturing company. He fought in Spain as a member of the International Brigades, which is most likely where he met Jankovic. They had one son, who died young.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn a 2005 leaked report known as the Wildstein List, the Tadlers were named among 240,000 Poles by the Polish communist government that linked all of them in some way to the Polish secret service. The list included former informers, secret service agents, and suspects of the Polish secret service without distinction. Although not everyone on the list was a spy, they were in some way under surveillance of the Polish government, and there is no way of knowing what degree of involvement the Tadlers had with the secret police.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nCzeslaw died on May 10, 1957 as a decorated Polish veteran, and his military funeral was held in Warsaw. Matylda lived the rest of her life in upstate New York, with her last known address in Westchester, and died at 59 in March 1970.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Though there is limited information available on Alexander Schwartzman, we can infer that his life was shaped by a profound sense of duty and a commitment to justice. He was a Jewish man living in a time where anti-Semitism was on the rise, Schwartz man&rsquo;s decision to join the fight against fascism wasn&rsquo;t merely an act of political defiance&ndash; it was a personal call to defend his community from the forces of hatred and bigotry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSchwartzman grew up in Brooklyn (40 Monroe St); he lived in the middle of 5 schools, so I would guess he attended elementary at P.S. 56 Lewis H Latimer (a block away) then headed to high school at one of the nearby locations (Urban Assembly Unison School or Bedford Academy High School). As a 26-year-old mail carrier from New York City, Schwartzman departed from the US on August 7th, 1937, aboard the Georgic. Although he was leaving behind his family, home, and the familiar streets of New York, his determination to join a just cause was unwavering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nUpon arriving in Spain via Massanet on August 19, 1937, Schwartzman joined the XV Brigade, an international brigade that was primarily composed of British and Irish volunteers. He underwent officer training school (OTS) and eventually became a part of the Lincoln Washington Battalion, a majority American group where he felt a stronger sense of camaraderie. As a Soldado, he fought valiantly alongside his fellow volunteers, standing against the fascists and defending the values of democracy. His service in the LW Battalion allowed him to forge bonds with fellow fighters who shared his dedication to a common cause and deepened his understanding of the human cost of war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOn March 10, 1938, during a series of retreats, Schwartzman was wounded in action near Caspe. Undeterred by his injury, he continued to serve in the war-torn country, displaying courage and resilience in the face of adversity. Finally, on August 28, 1938, Alexander Schwartzman returned to the United States aboard the De Grasse, forever changed by his experiences on the front lines of the Spanish Civil War.<br />\r\nThe outbreak of World War II found Schwartzman ready to serve again. His passion for the cause was evident in his swift response to the call to arms, joining the U.S. Army as a Staff Sergeant. This role demanded courage, leadership, and dedication - qualities that Schwartzman possessed in abundance, likely honed during his time in Spain. His time serving as a bombardier demonstrated his intense passion to counteract the devastation he had witnessed in Spain. His letter home, in which he describes his role as &quot;a dream coming true,&quot; reveals a man compelled not by a desire for violence, but by a wish for retaliation against the forces of fascism that had caused such destruction. There was a sense of personal vindication in being able to strike back against the tyranny he had seen first-hand. Furthermore, his role as an interpreter underscored his commitment to bridging divides and promoting understanding among allies. His knowledge of Spanish, gained during his time in Spain, was not only a practical skill but also a testament to his empathy and his willingness to connect with other cultures. By using his language skills to translate to the French, Schwartzman facilitated communication within the Allied forces, contributing to the coordination and cooperation necessary for the war effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAlexander Schwartzman passed away on September 7, 1989, in Branchport, Yates, New York, leaving behind a legacy of courage and resilience. He was laid to rest in Bath National Cemetery, Bath, New York, a symbol of his selflessness and devotion to the causes he held dear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAs we study and remember the life of Alexander Schwartzman, we are reminded of the importance of standing up for one&#39;s beliefs and the power of collective action. In a time of increasing global challenges, his story inspires us to continue the fight for justice, equality, and freedom for all, exemplifying the potential for ordinary people (why I couldn&rsquo;t find a picture of him) to make extraordinary contributions to the betterment of the world.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Bertram Bakerman was born on March 7th 1915. He grew up in Bay Ridge with three sisters (Florence, Anita, Rosalind) and five brothers (Theodore, Seymour, Harold, Edwin, Charles). His parents, John and Birdie, were Jewish immigrants from Russia and they probably immigrated due to the oppression Jewish people faced in Russia during the late 19th century. While many Jewish immigrants faced discimintion in America, his family did well for themselves. His dad was a Columbia-educated real estate lawyer who helped with the development of Bay Ridge and could afford many luxuries like maids. However, John did practice in a few shady business practices. In 1930, he was accused of theft and larceny.<br />\r\nDespite his father&rsquo;s career, Bertram got involved in Communism at a young age. He, alongside siblings Rosalind and Harold, joined many well-educated and idealistic Jewish Communists during this time.They thought that through their involvement in Communist movements, they would be able to get rid of the inequality that existed in the Great Depression and defeat Anti-Semitic movements like Nazism. He was well read in the writings of Communists Marx, Engels, Lening, and Mehring. His studies often focused on the history and development of Marxism. He first got involved with professional communist organizations during his college years at NYU. In 1934, he joined the Young Communist League and the National Students League, a grassroots Communist organization that first started as a protest against the City College of New York suspending a student who wrote an anti-ROTC article in a publication. He then joined the Communist Party proper in 1936.<br />\r\nWhen people around the world first started to go to Spain to fight in the war in 1937, Bakerman was determined to join them, but he couldn&rsquo;t join the first wave in the Abraham Lincoln Battalion in January 1937. He got a passport on February 17th 1937, and less than a month later, he was sailing on The Washington on March 10th. When he got to Spain on April 6th, he joined the other American latecomers in the Washington Battalion. Originally, the Battalion was going to be named after labor organizer Tom Mooney but the Communist Party stated that it would be &ldquo;politically expedient&rdquo; This brigade was led by Mirko Markovics. Mirko was the current head of the CPUSA&#39;s Serbian Section and the Yugoslav Coordinating Bureau and had war experience from being a Lieutenant in the Red Army. Bakerman and about 100 other volunteers faced great discipline and a lot of hardship. After becoming a formal battalion on April 30th, training began on May 10th. Most of the training happened in Tarazona, which began a week later. When the training was complete, they were told to move to the Jarama front, which proved to be difficult with the lack of resources and food. At Jarama, they withstood a difficult storm and a Nationalist attack. In early July, they participated in the Battle of Brunete. This battle proved to be deadly for the brigade. Around half of their men died and they had to join with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade as a consequence.<br />\r\nWhen fighting the war, Bertram was described as a good comrade, courageous, and disciplined, but a bit nervous. He had a good record in the frontlines and participated in the battles of Brunete, Quinto, and Belchite. Bertram was in the frontlines until July 1937 when he was injured in a battle at Villanueva de la Canada. He would return to the frontlines on August 2nd, 1937, in which he would participate in the Battle of Aragon. On September 24th, 1937, he was officially moved to the rear of the army after experiencing shell shock. He spent a lot of 1938 not in the fighting. He mainly worked in the censorship office at Valencia. He also served as a member of the International Red Relief (SRI) in February 1938 at Godella, Valencia, where he helped provide important services to the people living there. He ultimately returned to the United States on September 21st, 1938, around the time that Prime Minister Negrin removed International troops from Spain.<br />\r\nAfter the war, Bertram followed his father&rsquo;s footsteps and became a lawyer, but one that did not deal in shady business practices. He went to Brooklyn Law School, where he was an honor roll student and participated in student government. He passed the bar exam in May 1942. Before participating in law, he was enlisted in World War II in 1943. After the war, he married Esther Weintraub in 1948, presumably after he divorced his first wife Judith Novikoff, who he married in 1940. Bakerman joined the National Lawyers Guild, a progressive bar association that was founded as an alternative to the conservative American Bar Association. Their goal was to connect lawyers to cases that dealt with human rights and was the first bar association to be racially integrated. Many Communist Lawyers joined this association, to the point that the House Committee of Un-American activities declared it to be a &ldquo;Communist Front&rdquo; during the McCarthyism era. Bakerman participated in many cases. Most notably, he was a counsel for Robert Talbott Miller, an analyst for the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (OCIAA) who was accused of sending information to the Communist Golos network, in a hearing done by the Committee of Un-American activities. He ultimately died on March 11th, 1985 at the age of 70.</p>\r\n",

Abraham&rsquo;s parents, who were 11 years apart, were married at the time of his birth. His father, Joseph Sasson, was born in Tunis, Algeria, and he was a merchant tailor. He moved to the United States in 1914, just a year before Abraham was born, at which time he was 34 years old. Abraham&rsquo;s mother was also Algerian; she was 23 at the time of Abraham&rsquo;s birth and she considered herself a housewife. Abraham had 4 siblings total, all who were born before him. His father died in 1928.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbraham moved to New York in May, 1929, according to records from the &ldquo;Hebren Arphan Asylum&rdquo; (Hebrew Orphan Asylum) in Manhattan. The asylum was established in 1860 by the Hebrew Benevolent Society with the purpose of taking care of Jewish orphans. Abraham was placed at the asylum on May 11th, 1929, and he was 14 years old at the time. He was literate, he could read and write, and he attended school. Later, when he stationed himself in the Bronx, his address read 65 East 2nd Street, which today is 67 Stevenson Place. Starting in 1934, he became affiliated with the Communist Party. Prior to his time in the military, his primary occupation was a salesman.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbraham arrived in Spain through Setcases on July 5th, 1937. He served with the XV International Brigade of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade as adjutant Company Commander for the Lincoln-Washington Battalion. There are records that show he was arrested for enlistment with the Spanish Government Forces during his time there, but nothing came of it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbraham was involved in the Ebro offensive, in the Battle of Gandesa. Gandesa was the capital of the Terra Alta region in the province of Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain, and the Battle of Gandesa was part of the Ebro Offensive, a long set of battles by the Ebro river that eventually ended in the Republicans retreating and the Nationalists claiming the territory. At the end of February, the Nationalists had reached the outskirts of Gandesa. Abraham&rsquo;s brigade, the XV International Brigade had been retreating since the Aragon Offensive had begun (when Republican lines collapsed). The XV brigade decided to hold onto Gandesa to try to slow down advancing Nationalist troops, but alas, not much came of it. Gandesa fell on April 3rd, 1938 and 140 British and Americans were captured as prisoners. The resistance allowed Republicans to regroup and move over the Ebro River, but in his battle the Nationalists defeated one of the International Brigades and dug into Gandesa. From July to November 1938, Republicans tried to recapture, but failed, and their final retreat ended on November 10, 1938.

        "data": "<p>It was the year 1912 when one the heroic souls of the Lincoln Brigade would be brought into the world. Born in the paradise of Fajardo, Puerto Rico, Conrado Rosario Figueroa would rise to become one of many brave volunteers to join the fight against fascism and to make a stand as a member of the Young Communist League in New York City.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFigueroa was born in Puerto Rico, a United States territory but would not be considered an American citizen until the year 1917, when Congress granted Puerto Ricans citizenship status. With the Jones-Shafroth Act and the recent construction of the Panama Canal, many Puerto Ricans would find their way to the United States cultural centers, such as the big apple. Before leaving for Spain, Figueroa resided in 65 East 99th Street, an apartment building in East Harlem.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, Harlem was known as a symbol of the African American struggle movement and for being a rich and diverse community. As a Black man, Figueroa was looked down upon in Puerto Rico where many racial tensions occurred between White residents and Puerto Ricans with African Descent. In the United States, where racial oppression was a major issue and only worsened with the Great Depression, groups such as the Communist Party became communities where everyone could feel empowered and a sense of belonging and unity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe revolutionary spirit of 1930s Harlem spread throughout the nation, African Americans throughout the nation feeling inspired to speak out injustice and take action. For Conrado Rosario Figueroa, that meant leaving the vibrant community of Harlem where he worked as a clerk to sail the Queen Mary ship in 1937. Headed to fight for the republic, Figueroa was one of several brave African American volunteers that would fight in the Brunete Campaign of 1937.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThousands of young soldiers, many without having ever held a gun in their life before, would be heading to Villanueva de la Canada to prevent a takeover of Madrid. Regardless of such, members of the 15th international brigade, which was composed of the British, George Washington and Lincoln battalions quickly united to defend the Spanish Republic. As a part of the Lincoln Brigade, Conrado Rosario proudly represented his identity as an African American and was determined to continue showing the excellence of the brigade that had been shown during the Jarama Valley battle. For people like Figueroa, defending the territory from nationalist takeover was more than a physical battle. It was a fight for humanity, a world where everyone had rights and democracy could take place.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the ninth of July of 1937, Figueroa would sacrifice his own life to defend a justly voted government and a global cause. While many international volunteers would be seen as dispensable because they were not Spanish, Conrado Rosario Figueroa will always be remembered as a resilient spirit who proudly represented the Black community and fought for what he believed was right: a just government and equal nation. It was brave minorities like Figeuroa who set an example for others to fight for others and their own rights as well.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Pasquale Cicitta was born in New York City on January 9th, 1910. His parents, Sebastiano and Santa Cicitta, were born and married in Sortino, Italy. Pasquale&rsquo;s father arrived in the United States in 1907, and his mother joined Sebastiano two years later. Sebastino and Santa were a part of the mass migration from Italy to the United States, which was at an all-time high between the 1900s and 1910s. Sebastino came to the United States as a laborer, and the Cicittas had some security in knowing they had family in the United States.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPasquale lived in Melrose, a neighborhood in the Bronx. Melrose was primarily a German community in the 19th century and steadily became a safe haven for Italian and Irish immigrants in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Pasquale maintained his Italian heritage and grew up with two brothers. Cicitta worked as a metal worker and machinist and was a part of the metal workers union. Pasquale visited Italy once before fighting in the Spanish Civil War and arrived back from the trip in 1926. Mussolini became Italy&rsquo;s fascist dictator in 1925, and therefore, Pasquale witnessed the fascist and totalitarian Italy on his trip. His drive to fight in the Spanish Civil War probably stemmed from seeing a fascist dictator in his parents&rsquo; homeland and wanting to fight against the terror that spread across the country. Additionally, Pasquale voted for the communist ticket in the 1936 New York City general election. In a survey completed by Pasquale on October 31st, 1938, for the War Commissariat of the International Brigades, he wrote that he supported the People&rsquo;s Front&rsquo;s policies because it was a &ldquo;policy of unification of political parties and trade unions. A unification of all those who love peace and liberty.&rdquo; Pasquale went to Spain to fight fascism, advocate for trade unions, fight for his communist ideals, and spread peace and liberty.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPasquale Cicitta left for Spain in March 1937 to fight with the Garibaldi Battalion (which became the Garibaldi Brigade in April 1937) in the XII International Brigade after receiving his passport on February 26th, 1937. The battalion mainly consisted of Italian communists, a group of people he interacted with in Melrose and Italy and shared similar beliefs with. The war would become very personal, as the Garibaldi Battalion directly fought Italian fascist forces.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe first served at Huesca, where Republicans launched a failed offensive attack against the Nationalists for about seven days. A few weeks later, he went to Brunete. Republicans went into the Battle of Brunete to divert Nationalist attention after the capture of Biblao and capture the Extremadura road to stop Nationalists from supplying their army in Madrid. The battle ended with the Republicans holding some municipalities from the Nationalists, failing to block the Extremadura road, and having massive casualties. Cicitta then went to Fuentes de Ebro so that Republican forces would have a path to Zaragoza, but it was a failed offensive. Afterwards, he served in Extremadura for about eight months and then went to fight in the Battle of Caspe. The Republicans attempted to stop the Nationalists from advancing through Caspe but failed to do so.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn April 1938, after the Battle of Caspe, Pasquale was punished for negligence and did not receive ten days&rsquo; worth of pay. After two months, Cicitta went on to the Battle of Ebro, the longest battle during the Spanish Civil War. The battle was an attempt to connect Catalonia back with Republican land. However, the nationalists were better suited for this battle of attrition, resulting in their victory. The Battle of Ebro had tens of thousands of casualties and could be seen as the military defeat of the Republic. Through the battles Pasquale served in, he went from sergeant (sargento) to lieutenant (teniente). During his time in Spain, he took an eight-day leave to Barcelona, the center of the Republican efforts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPasquale returned to the United States after the Ebro Offensive. The sheer number of casualties and loss in morale, especially as a lieutenant, affected Pasquale and influenced his decision to leave. The more significant reason for his departure was the disbanding of international brigades. The Garibaldi Brigade was dissolved in September 1938, and international brigades were demanded to withdraw from Spain in October 1938 due to the Munich Conference. He returned on the Ausonia, a ship that carried American volunteers from France to the US, and arrived in New York on December 20th, 1938. Through his journey, he learned that &ldquo;through unity a war can be resisted &hellip; unity, good morale &hellip; thinking&rdquo;, as stated in his response to the survey for the War Commissariat of the International Brigades. He also learned Spanish to add onto his English and Italian knowledge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter returning from Spain, Pasquale married Margaret Orsini on October 23rd, 1940. One year later, they had a son named Anthony. Pasquale likely met Margaret through his brother, as Margaret&rsquo;s sister, Eva, married Pasquale&rsquo;s brother, Sebastiano, in 1937. Pasquale died on Janurary 24, 1971.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Stelios Topolianos (also known as Stellos Topolinakis, Stelios Arlenius, Steilias Topolionas, Toplianos) was born in Crete, a Greek island in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, on January 1, 1900 (although some sources claim it to be 1899 or as far back as January 17, 1887). Topolianos was a first-generation immigrant and part of the Greek Diaspora during early 20th century. Due to an increase in economic opportunities in the U.S. and the unrest caused by Ottoman rule and the Balkan Wars, Topolianos moved to the United States. Coming to New York, he passed through Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty and adopted the name Steve Topolianos.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany Greeks, like Topolianos, moved to New York City and involved themselves in industrial jobs, especially the garment industry. To improve their economic standings and start anew, Topolianos lived at 266 West 41st Street (269 West 26th Street) in the Garment District, where fur workers were among the highest-paid industrial workers in the city. Topolianos dropped out of school early, only completing the 6th grade, most likely because he needed to work for his family considering his father was widowed. Topolianos never attended high school or college to further his education. On November 5, 1924, Topolianos enlisted in the National Guard as part of the 104th Ambulance Company of the 102nd Medical Regiment of the 27th Infantry Division at their divisional headquarters, 56 West 66th Street. The records may have erroneously listed him as Steilias Topolionas. He served in the National Guard for 3 years, under the &ldquo;first modern field hospital unit&rdquo; in the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the military, Topolianos worked in the needle trade. He arrived at a time when the Garment District became the fastest-growing site of construction in the entire city. Despite this, Topolianos was not satisfied with his working conditions nor was he satisfied with the American Dream. In 1929, the Great Depression severely hit the garment industry, and Topolianos&rsquo;s wages dropped. Dissatisfied, Topolianos joined a needle trades worker&rsquo;s union in 1930 and later, the Communist Party in 1932. The union was part of the Fur Workers Industrial Union, which was subject to a lot of communist influence during this time, radicalizing Topolianos. On February 3, 1933, Topolianos attacked Milton Silverman, who was the owner of a dress company. Topolianos wanted to convince Silverman&#39;s workers to join his union. Topolianos was charged under &ldquo;class action&rdquo; and stayed in prison for 18 months. Eventually, the Communist Party dissolved the union and left many members alone or forced to join moderate unions. Seeing the betrayal of the Communist party unfold right before his eyes, Topolianos probably became even more motivated to protect his Communist ideals. He believed that if his fellow workers would not help him here, he would have to seek another way to protect the ideology.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn December 22, 1936, Topolianos received his passport (#358485) and boarded the SS Normandie on December 26, disguised as a tourist. He was part of the first contingent of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade to fight in Spain. The SS Normandie made a secret trip directly to France. Topolianos took a train to the base of the Pyrenees Mountains and trekked through them into Catalonia. Since the French border guard prohibited anyone from coming into Spain, the volunteers had to trek through the Pyrenees at night. Many volunteers along the way got lost or fell. Topolianos arrived in Spain on January 6, 1937, in the nick of time, as 5 days later, the United States would invalidate all passports to Spain and ban all shipments of weapons to Spain. He was repatriated that same month and the U.S. government demanded he return, but Topolianos refused to comply. For Topolianos, training mostly consisted of screening checks to determine whether the volunteers were committed to the fight against fascism via interviews. Communist indoctrinations were often done in French, which Topolianos did not understand a single word of. Topolianos&#39;s training was mostly marching. Fortunately, his prior experience in the National Guard would give him a chance at survival. Because he served as a medic in the National Guard, Topolianos was attached to the XV International Brigade&rsquo;s Lincoln Batallion&rsquo;s Machine Gun Company as its &ldquo;Sanitari&rdquo;, or its first-aid man. He served under the MG Company&rsquo;s commanding officer, Douglas Seacord, who had enrolled in West Point. Seacord had 7 years of prior military experience and gave valuable training to Topolianos and his men on how to fight and operate a machine gun.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn February 6, 1937, the battle of Jarama began. Topolianos was involved in the battle of Pingarr&oacute;n, most commonly known as Suicide Hill. The attack commenced with a charge over the top at 3 PM on February 23. The 1st Company Commander, Captain John Scott, was shot and wounded during the charge. Topolianos and another soldier, Joe M. Gordon, carried Scott on a stretcher to the first-aid station. Despite being under heavy fire from the Nationalists, Topolianos was left unscathed. Topolianos and Gordon went out again and carried another wounded ally, David Shappiro, back to the first-aid station. Topolianos&rsquo; bravery would earn him the nickname &ldquo;Dare-devil First Aid man of the Lincolns&rdquo;. Despite Topolianos and the volunteers&rsquo; best efforts, Scott died from his wounds later that day. A week later, Shappiro would also succumb to his wounds on March 4. While Topolianos worked tirelessly in the first-aid station to keep soldiers alive, the attack was called off at 10 PM and the company retreated to their original positions. On February 27, Jarama Valley turned into a stalemate, ending the battle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the battle, he was described to be dependable, highly disciplined, a hard worker, and extremely courageous by his superiors. He became popular with the battalion and a &ldquo;very good Greek comrade&rdquo;, especially with his performance as a lookout for the battalion. Despite this, many agreed that he needed more &ldquo;political education&rdquo;. Topolianos became a hero and part of Dr. Pike&rsquo;s First Aid Men. They eased conditions on the battlefield by providing latrines, kitchens, water supply, trenches, and dug-outs for the soldiers. Topolianos, who received the nickname, &ldquo;Tops&rdquo;, attended Dr. Pike&rsquo;s classes on hygiene and First Aid and furthered his knowledge of medicine to help more people in the future. On March 31, 1937, Topolianos was wounded in the arm while fighting at Aragon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn July 6, 1937, the Battle of Brunete began and Topolianos served as part of the V Army Corps. At Mosquito Ridge, Topolianos played a crucial role as First Aid Man, putting his life on the line multiple times. He ran to the wounded in the most exposed positions, and quickly bandaged them up, before carrying them as much as five kilometers back to the medical stations. July 15, the offensive was stopped from mounting Nationalist reinforcements. During the battle, Topolianos, like many other soldiers, suffered from extreme heat and a lack of water. Fortunately, many of the villagers welcomed the international brigades and provided hospitality. Topolianos, along with the other medics, helped the villagers with whatever problems they had. Most of the cases were towards treating children&rsquo;s ailments. Topolianos sometimes cared for Nationalist soldiers, most of them being young Moorish soldiers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough some sources point out that this marked the end of Topolianos&rsquo; service in Spain, with him leaving in July 1937, he remained in Spain, although not on the front. On January 18, 1938, he was repatriated to Alicante and like most other repatriated soldiers, underwent political indoctrination. At Alicante, he worked at the Belissa military hospital. Topolianos returned home on April 1, 1938, aboard the SS Washington via the New-York Hamburg Line. He may have been forced to return because of his lack of zeal for the cause.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn August 14, 1938, Topolianos arrived in London and came back to Spain to restart his fight. This was unluckily timed though. On September 21, 1938, Republican prime minister, Juan Negrin announced the withdrawal of all international brigades to try to appease Britain and France. By expelling communist volunteers, he hoped to gain support from other nations. With Negrin&rsquo;s announcement, Topolianos went to Le Havre to board the MV Brittanic, a British passenger line using the New-York Hamburg Line. He disguised himself as an immigrant coming to the U.S. for the first time. Topolianos arrived at Cobh, Ireland and New York on September 17 and September 25 respectively.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring his overall time in Spain, Topolianos was promoted to sergeant and served at various military hospitals, such as the aforementioned Benissa and Madrid military hospitals. He became his company&rsquo;s political delegate of the Sanitary Service and traveled with the Brigade to give first aid at the drop of a hat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUpon returning to New York, he rented a different place at 325 West 25th Street in Manhattan. He worked as an operator for the Kessen Bros, a shoe manufacturer, on 115 West 30th Street. With the Great Depression still on, he struggled to find a long-term job. In 1939, he only worked 10 weeks. Topolianos was later drafted for World War II on February 15, 1942, three months after the Pearl Harbor attack. Topolianos may have filled out the date wrong since the Third Draft started on February 16. With his experience, it is likely he served as a combat medic for the army. Had he been assigned to his old unit, the 27th Infantry Division, Topolianos would have fought in the battle of Makin, Saipan, Einwetok, and Okinawa. After WWII, Topolianos found love with Asimina Contogiannis, a Greek-American born in New Jersey in 1923. They married on April 20, 1949. In 1950, they moved to 354 East 5th Street in Manhattan and Topolianos worked sewing coats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSteve Topolianos died in March of 1980.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Max Katz was born on May 1, 1917 (though according to ancestry.com he was born in 1907), in the capital of Ukraine, Kiev (Kyiv). At the time, Ukraine was still a part of Russia. Before joining the brigade, he had 4 years of military service in the US Army Air Corps (USAAC) under his belt. Here, Katz served as a mechanic. Since the USAAC was the aerial warfare service component of the US army at the time, he probably worked on aircraft maintenance. Even though he didn&rsquo;t gain any front-line combat experience from these four years, Katz was able to join the Abraham Lincoln Brigade with war experience, and knowing how war in general works. After, Katz became a longshoreman where he did waterfront manual labor. He joined the Young Communist League (YCL) in 1936. The longshoremen were unionized at this point, which might have influenced his pull toward the YCL. On December 21, 1936, Katz received passport #358110. On it, his address was listed as 173 Henry St, NYC in the Lower East Side. His building was built in 1920. Before being sailed off, the volunteers, including Katz, received a Bon Voyage party in the Second Avenue Yiddish Theater where they each were given a gift bag containing Lucky Strike cigarettes, G. Washington coffee, two bars of Palmolive soap, and a Gillette razor. On December 26, he sailed aboard the SS Normandie, a French ocean liner, with his fellow volunteers. He was the 49th entry on their &ldquo;Sail List&rdquo; which kept track of the volunteers going to Spain. They docked in Le Havre, France on December 31 and then took a boat train to Paris and then to Perpignan. They then boarded buses with other brigades to cross the border into Spain. They arrived in Albacete on January 6, 1937, where the volunteers were enrolled in their separate brigades. Katz served with the 15th brigade, the Lincoln Batallion. In May 1937, after intense fighting, he was pulled from the front lines because of his age. He was sent back to the US aboard the De Grasse, a French cruiser, on August 1, 1937. He may have also fought with the Jaroslav Dombrowski Brigade - the Polish Jewish volunteers - in the Spanish Civil war. The first of these volunteers fought at Irun on August 28, 1936. They were also the last to leave Spain. Later in his life, Katz joined the WWII Armed forces. On June 17, 1943, he married Estelle Gaylick, born in Chicago on December 17, 1910. They had a daughter named Anne Katz. He later remarried to Eleanore Levy. With her, he had a son named Elliot Katz and three daughters: Lisa Katz Keiner, Rachel Katz, and Anne Katz. Katz died on January 27, 1981, in Milford, Connecticut.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Joseph Thomas Kaplan (nicknamed Joe) was born on February 23rd, 1905, and grew up in New York City. Kaplan graduated with a Bachelor in Arts and was married.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe lived at 248 West 17th Street, NYC, which is located in the neighborhood of Chelsea today. He lived three streets away from the neighborhood of Little Spain (Peque&ntilde;a Espa&ntilde;a), which was home to many working-class Spanish immigrants, especially in the 1930s. Most residents of Little Spain eagerly supported the Republic, although there were a few pro-Franco supporters. Places such as the Spanish Benevolent Society and Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe were located in Little Spain and served as crucial cultural centers for the community. Famous artists, such as the poet Federico Garcia Lorca, were said to also frequent Little Spain quite often.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe New School was also located half a mile away from his residence. In 1933, they established the University in Exile and the &Eacute;cole libre des hautes &eacute;tudes graduate divisions for scholars that escaped Nazi Germany and other dictatorships at the time. The motto of the school is &ldquo;To the Living Spirit.&rdquo; At the time, Nazis had taken down a plaque with the words &ldquo;be the Living Spirit&rdquo; at the University of Heidelberg. Thomas Mann suggested that the New School use this as their motto, as the &ldquo;living spirit&rdquo; in Europe was being threatened, so it would have a home in the United States.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe worked as a teacher and journalist and was part of the Communist Party in 1934. As a unit education director, he was in charge of assigning Marxist readings to his allies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKaplan was also Jewish. Jewish volunteers were among the first to fight in Spain and thousands went to fight in the war, in order to fight back against fascism and antisemitism. It is estimated that over a third of those from the USA participating in the Spanish Civil War were Jewish.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe received passport #426926 on May 27th, 1937. Kaplan arrived in Spain through the town of Setcases in Catalonia on June 19, 1937, after sailing for 17 days aboard the Aquitania. However, Canadian records state he sailed on September 21, 1937. He served as a soldier in the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion (Mac-Paps), a battalion originating from Canada and part of the Abraham Lincoln brigade. The battalion was named after William Lyon Mackenzie and Louis-Joseph Papineau, two Canadians that led the Canadian Rebellion of 1837-1838.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKaplan was killed in action between March 9th to 10th, 1938 in Belchite during a retreat through Aragon. The Aragon Offensive was an important military campaign led by Franco on March 7th, 1938, and it was a very well-prepared attack on the Republican forces in Aragon. By this time, the Republican forces already had their resources drained in the Battle of Teruel, leaving them with not much to work with. The Republican forces quickly collapsed and were forced to make a fighting retreat through Belchite, Lecera, Vinaceite, and Caspe (which was eventually surrendered on March 15th).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Republicans were able to fight back when they reached Batea; however, this only gave them a short amount of time before the Nationalists led another offensive in the south of Aragon on March 30th. A battalion of the Republican forces mistook Italian forces for those of General Lister&rsquo;s Communist 5th Regiment, which ultimately led to their downfall and only eighty volunteers of the entire battalion made it out to Gandesa. They eventually retreated to the River Ebro; however, many Republicans were captured or killed while trying to swim across the dangerous river in an attempt to make it to the other side.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Philip Crane (Also known as Jacob/Jack Rotter; or Phillip/Philip Conway) was born on March 21, 1910, in NYC. He was Jewish and of Austrian descent. Although there is no solid evidence of the identity of Rotter&rsquo;s parents, they were likely to be Hyman Rotter and Annie Rotter, who immigrated to the United States in 1904.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn the 1930s, Crane was a student, and it was during the economic depression that he got involved with the YCL. Many young men from New York City who volunteered to fight in the Spanish Civil War were initially part of the Young Communist League. In mid-1935, the YCL membership amounted to 8,000 people. The organization consisted of students and unemployed young men. When Crane Philip received his passport in 1937, he listed his address as 411 Hinsdale Street, Brooklyn, New York. During that time, Hinsdale Street belonged to the East New York neighborhood. Crane Philip arrived in Spain on March 17, 1937. During the time Crane Philip spent in Spain, the war outcome was still hard to predict. In June, General Mola died, and in August, Madrid was bombed for the first time by the Nationalists. In few months after his arrival, on November 10, Philip Crane violated military discipline by deserting, presumably from Tarazona, with Bernard Abramofsky and Albert Wallach. Tarazona de la Mancha was a town where the soldiers of the Lincoln Brigade trained in the summer of 1937. Bernard Abramofsky (also known as Bernard Aibel) was Jewish and of Russian descent; he was born in Brooklyn, NYC, on April 21, 1914, to Ida and Isadore Abramofsky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was an actor before the war and was involved with the Young Communist League in 1934. Abramofsky served in the XV Brigade, Washington Battalion. It is not evident how Abramofsky and Crane came to know each other; it is most likely when the Washington unit and the Lincoln Battalion merged during the Brunete campaign (6-25 July 1937). The Brunete battle was a Republican offensive that initially succeeded but ultimately failed with devastating casualties for the Republic. Abramofsky became shell-shocked on the first day of the Brunete, and his morale steadily declined until he finally deserted with Wallach and Crane.The number of deserters from the Lincoln Brigade can be placed at about one hundred or four percent of total volunteers. Throughout the war, a stream of men wanted to flee the battlefield, but the numbers increased greatly during and after major battles. The most common route of escape was through one of the major Spanish ports like Barcelona and Valencia. Then they would sail away from the ports through the help of sympathetic seamen. In fact, on July 24, 1937, four Americans from the Washington battalion had arrived at the U.S embassy in Valencia and requested assistance in returning home. These four men were James Doyle, Vachel Lindsay Blair, Robert G. Bready, and Hamilton Alden Tyler. When the four men were refused help by the consul, they decided to go to Barcelona where they were captured by the Spanish officials and jailed. In the end, the four Americans were successfully evacuated from Spain with the permission of the Republican authorities. Most likely Wallach, Crane, and Abramofsky had heard about this ordeal and wanted to replicate it. As a result, they also went to the U.S. Embassy in Valencia for an appeal to return home. After the consul refused to help, the three men departed Valencia and went to Barcelona for a repatriation request. They were arrested in Barcelona and jailed in Albacete. However, unlike the case of the earlier four men , the Republican authorities were becoming stricter in their handling of deserters. In the end, Abramofsky got assassinated by the Republican official based on him threatening the unity and morale of his battalion because of his several attempts to desert even after getting captured in Barcelona. Wallach, who was also Jewish, met a similar fate. After he was re-arrested in civilian clothes around Barcelona, after his 3rd attempt to flee, Wallach was confined in the brigade prison at Castillo de Fells. In the end, Wallach was murdered brutally by Spanish Military Intelligence. Philip Crane, on the other hand, managed to return to the U.S. on October 25, 1938, aboard the Ill de France.</p>\r\n",

She was an immigrant from Torntino, Russia, having studied nursing at Jewish Maternity Hospital Training School, and thereafter to be an X-ray technician at Hunter College. She was described as shy, being five feet four, with brown hair and eyes. She was naturalized on June 2, 1931 in the U.S. District Court at Brooklyn. Although her husband, a post office employee named Arthur Peer, warned her of the dangers of going to Spain, she left everything behind to help the efforts, just a month after she had gotten her U.S. passport in 1937. She served with the Medical Services in the Taranc&oacute;n sector. Arriving in Spain on April 11, 1937, the hospital where she was working was bombed several times, and she eventually had her ribs broken by shrapnel. Even though she herself was injured, she helped out others who had lighter injuries than herself in the aftermath of the attack. She had to be sent to Paris to recuperate from her injuries for four months. While on a ship ride to join her in Spain, her husband died due to a heart attack on December 31st. They never got to reunite. In May the following year, she went back to Spain, being responsible for the Hospital de S&#39;agar&oacute; until the end of the war in March of 1939. She was the only American nurse to be cited for bravery by the Loyalist government. Perhaps due to the fact that she participated in the Spanish efforts for freedom, which was linked to Communism, and her birthplace, Sonia&rsquo;s name was listed in the hearings before the United States Senate Committee of the Judiciary on Soviet activities within the United States. She would later marry Alex Kolkin after the war had ended in 1968 in New York City. She died in California.</p>\r\n    ",

        "data": "<p>Rubin (&ldquo;Ruby&rdquo;) Schneiderman was born on April 21, 1915, in Brooklyn, New York. His parents were Rose Zuckerman and Max Schneiderman, and he was Jewish. His father immigrated from Russia, and his mother came from Romania. He had three older brothers: Harry, Louis, and Isidore, and a younger sister: Ruth. He graduated from Osing High School in New York in three years and had no further formal education. According to the Soviet archives, Schneiderman joined the Communist Party in 1932. Possibly as a result of joining the party, he decided to acquire some military training through the Citizen&rsquo;s Military Training Camp at Fort Dix, New Jersey, for four weeks each summer from 1934-1936. CMTCs were military training programs held across the country each summer from 1921 to 1940. They were a legacy of &ldquo;preparedness camps&rdquo; created during World War I but before the US entered it, to train potential officers in the event of war. The camps taught physical fitness, discipline, and basic use of weaponry.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schneiderman was unmarried at the time of the Spanish Civil War and worked as a shipping clerk at a clothing store, organizing the union there. When he decided to volunteer in Spain, he applied for a passport and received passport number 364705 on February 1, 1937. In his passport, he had two addresses listed, one at 1273 Stebbins Avenue, in the Bronx, and the other at 1703 Union Street, in Brooklyn. His address in the Bronx was likely his primary residence. He left for Europe aboard the &ldquo;Paris&rdquo; on February 6, 1937, just five days after getting his passport. He finally arrived in Spain on February 15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schneiderman fought with the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, in the XV Brigade, first with Company 2, Section 1, Group 2, and later with Company 1. Just twelve days after arriving in Spain, he was wounded in action at the failed attack on Pingarr&oacute;n, on February 27, 1937, within the Battle of Jarama. He was soon able to recover and rejoin the fighting. He was injured again at the battle of Brunete. He then became Master Sergeant in charge of Americans at a rehabilitation center behind the front. Due to his injuries, he returned to the US on September 24, 1937, on the &ldquo;DeGrasse&rdquo;, ending his participation in the Spanish Civil War.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding Jewish volunteers in general, it is estimated that 38% of American volunteers in the war and 25% of all international volunteers were Jews. These are relatively large percentages considering that only 4% of the US population and less than 1% of the world was Jewish at the time. But despite the large number of Jews who fought, there has been relatively little mentioned about their impact because of the Soviet role as historians and archivists of the war. The Soviet Union&rsquo;s control of much of the documentation surrounding the war and their anti-Israel stance in later years led to a minimization of the important role played by Jews in the war, especially by American and British historians. In many cases, historians emphasized the socialist beliefs that many Jews held rather than the additional factor that Judaism played for so many in their desire to fight fascism. But despite Jews being ignored internationally, in Spain, there has always been open recognition of the many Jews who came to fight. Moreover, many Jews used aliases to hide their religion, so the real number who volunteered could potentially be much higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After serving in the Spanish Civil War, Schneiderman got married at some point before October 16, 1940, to a woman named Dorothy. He enlisted in the US Army as a Private on May 5, 1943, soon after he turned 28 years old. Despite all of his experience from the Spanish Civil War, he would serve stateside during World War II. It is possible that like many veterans of the International Brigades, he was discriminated against during World War II because of his perceived Communist beliefs. There was no formal policy of discrimination, but many veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion complained about how they weren&rsquo;t given an opportunity to fight in Europe despite their combat experience. In a letter Schneiderman sent in May of 1943 to someone named Jack, (most likely Jack Bjoze, the Executive Secretary of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade at the time), he wrote, &ldquo;I got 128 on the army test and you only need 110-120 for officers school. After the test I got an [...] interview about the [Abraham Lincoln] Brigade and then they put &lsquo;Probable leadership&rsquo; down on my papers which is promising.&rdquo; But despite his qualifications, Schneiderman was sent to an M.P (military police) training center at Fort Ontario. In another letter to Jack, he told him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had some interesting talks with my Louie [Lieutenant] and also the Public Relations and Intelligence officer here at the Post and I told them all about my Spain experience. He seemed very much interested but said I could do nothing about getting out of limited service because my eyes are 20/40 without glasses, but they can&rsquo;t keep a good man down or as the saying goes, &lsquo;talent will win out&rsquo;.&rdquo; In a letter from a year later, Schneiderman wrote, &ldquo;I was DISQUALIFIED for overseas service on two counts, eyes and feet and between you and I, I can&rsquo;t honestly say it was a surprise to me.&rdquo; But he still stayed upbeat, joking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been destined to be an M.P. ever since I stopped a fight between two 9 year old kids, 10 years ago.&rdquo; The thing that stands out the most from Schneiderman&rsquo;s letters is his positive attitude despite being confined to a non-combat role. Schneiderman would serve as an M.P. at various military prisons and POW camps for the duration of the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was released from the army on March 11, 1946. Rubin Schneiderman died on June 11, 2001, at the age of 86, in Charlottesville, Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>William &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; McCarthy was born on June 22, 1912 in NYC. When Bill was six years old, his father died from a diabetic coma. With few resources, Bill was forced to move from the Upper West Side to the slums of Brooklyn. Following his father&rsquo;s death, Bill&rsquo;s family worked with a social worker who helped manage finances and provide care; his mother did not work until Bill was an adult and she worked at telephone answering service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the death of his father, Bill quickly became the head of the family. He first attended a parochial school, St. John&#39;s College Jesuit High School, where the Jesuit fathers singled him out for future priesthood. The Jesuits offered Bill a scholarship to Brooklyn Prep; during his time there, Bill was trained by the National Guard - he learnt to ride a horse and load weapons - and his experience made him valuable later on in Spain. Bill was supposed to attend Holy Cross, but the Great Depression hit and he could not afford to attend. He then began working on Wall Street after graduating from St. Johns. During the Depression, Bill worked 18-hour days as a bellboy for a meager $30 a month. What discouraged Bill most was working long, cumbersome hours and later being robbed. After losing his job as a bellboy in 1936, he became a sailor. Unfortunately, the union Bill now belonged to- the Marine Industrial Union - was full of philanderers; Bill grew so frustrated that he helped create a new union of which he became the first business agent for in 1937.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill decided to go to Spain once he found out he would be paid for being a business agent for his union and could send back money to his family. He travelled to Spain in 1937 and entered through France, first landing in Paris and from there traveling through the Pyrenees. He was guided by Spanish guards and smugglers who took them along smuggler routes. Once in Spain, he was among over 40,000 other international volunteers; they first travelled to Figueras in Catalonia and stayed in the Sant Ferran Castle, an old Spanish fortress while on their way to serve. They finally arrived in Barcelona, where the anarchists rejected the internationals. From Barcelona, Bill alongside the rest of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, travelled to Albacete where the group received extremely rudimentary training - such as how to load a gun and its different parts. Because of his training in his school years, Bill was considered valuable in Spain. The first battle in which he fought was in Aragon in late September of 1937 when the Republic went on the offensive. During this battle, the Abraham Lincoln Brigade successfully captured Belchite and while in resting position, Bill met Ernest Hemingway and Martha Gellhorn, who were married at the time. The couple offered food, resources, and their hotel room to the members of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, which many in the brigade took advantage of.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his time in Belchite, following the capture of the town, Bill was hit by a concussion grenade, dropping him in a crash of shrapnel and ruble and severely injuring him and five of his fellow soldiers. As per his brigade commissar&rsquo;s orders, Bill and the five others injured were sent to a hospital which Bill described was for &ldquo;cracked out&rdquo; people (mentally ill). After a year in the hospital, Bill sought to volunteer once again after hearing of Mussolini&rsquo;s continued success in Spain. In 1939, while serving in Genoa and contacting Italian anti-fascists, Bill was captured for drunkenly slandering Il Duce - Mussolini. Once captured, he was abused and tortured by fascist forces, including being forced to drink castor oil. Though his sentence was supposed to be only two weeks, Bill was only released after three months once his wife Shirley, along with other seamen from Bill&rsquo;s crew, pushed Roosevelt&rsquo;s state department to pressure Mussolini for Bill&rsquo;s release.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twelve years later, Bill remained committed to his fight against anti-fascism and freedom. In 1951, during a protest against the Korean War in Union Square, NY, Bill was arrested and beaten by New York City police for climbing a lamppost and spewing anti-war rhetoric. The policemen repeatedly stomped on Bill and kicked him, causing permanent damage to his left eye. Bill&rsquo;s physical health continued to deteriorate and towards the end of his life, he became an alcoholic. Though Bill suffered greatly in his final days, he supported the anti-fascist cause till the end. Throughout his life, he was awarded several honors and even became an Executive Committee member in the National Maritime Union (NMU). Bill McCarthy was also closely acquainted with Bill Bailey, whom McCarthy requested, &ldquo;if I pass on before you, would you promise me, now, that you will get my ashes to Spain and bury them at Belchite so I can rest at peace among my brave comrades and friends who died in the war?&rdquo; Bill Bailey honored this request when Bill McCarthy passed away in 1987.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Solomon Davis was born on November 15th, 1915, was the son of Israel Davis. Davis was a Jewish volunteer and was a member of the Young Communist League, since 1934, that volunteered after Franco threatened to &quot;turn Spain back to 1493&quot;, a time where persecution of Jewish people was widespread in the Iberian peninsula. Solomon&#39;s first name also means peace in Hebrew and his surname Davis derives from the Jewish figure David. Davis secured passport #391335 on April 15, 1937. Davis&#39; passport listed his age as 23 at the time of receiving the passport. His home address was also listed as 924 Stone Ave, Brooklyn, NY. Davis lived around the Ocean Hill area of Bedford-Stuyvesant which had a predominant Jewish population. Davis departed from New York to Holland on the SS Volendam and soon travelled to the city of Marseille, France. At Marseille, Davis boarded the ocean liner Ciudad de Barcelona which had been transporting volunteers and supplies to Spain. During the trip, the Ciudad de Barcelona was intercepted by torpedoes from Nationalist Submarines and subsequently sunk off the coast of Malgrat de Mar. The ciudad de Barcelona had been carrying 200-250 volunteers of the International Brigade with 60-65 crew members perishing, 12 of which were American volunteers. Davis finally arrived to Spain on June 2nd. During training, Davis broke his arm and served with the XV BDE. During his first mission at the battle of Bruente, Davis was shell shocked and eventually deserted from the frontlines. The battle of Brunete was well planned and prepared as a diversion of Nationalist troops who were pressuring the capital of Madrid. The battle of Brunete saw initial success until devastating casualties forced the Republican troops to retreat. Despite Republican officers discussing the plans openly in cafes located at Republican controlled cities for three months, the Nationalists were caught off guard. However, the hilly terrain and ridges proved to be a challenging factor in the difficult mission to break the Nationalist lines. Combined with the slow and obsolete Republican air force against the Condor Legion and Republican heavy bombardment having little to no effect, Davis would soon desert from the battlefield after Nationalist reinforcements arrived and an African American commander, Oliver Law, was found KIA in the battle for Mosquito Ridge. The combination of extreme heat, lack of water, a concussion, massive numbers of Nationalist air support and heavy casualties led to a shell shocked Davis. Soon after, Davis returned and was repatriated under medical reasons and was sent back to the US on September 12th, 1937, aboard the RMS Ausonia. Republican documents state that Davis had little to no contributions to the brigade and had already broken his arm prior to his training in Spain. Another member of the Washington brigade, John Hunter, provided unfavorable reports on Davis during his time in Spain.

        "data": "<p>William Gresham was born in Baltimore Maryland on August 20th, 1909.&nbsp; Shortly after his birth his family of Maryland natives moved to New York City, where Gresham would attend Erasmus Hall High School.&nbsp; He became fascinated with the Coney Island sideshow as a child, and it proved to play a huge role in his life.&nbsp; He began to work there as a child, and the things he saw inspired him to become a writer.&nbsp; He would later write about his experiences in his book <em>Monster Midway: An Uninhibited Look at the Glittering World of the Carny</em>, where after seeing an attached set of twins he writes &ldquo;I thought it would be wonderful to have a vestigial twin, I wouldn&rsquo;t have to work as hard as my father did, bossing around people in a factory all day &hellip; Bitterly I realized it was too late for me to be gifted like the italian gentleman, but hope surged within me that someday I might get tattooed all over and so qualify.&rdquo;&nbsp; He practiced magic, and at one point almost killed himself while attempting a Houdini act. Gresham dreamed of being a carny and a writer, feeling that he wasn&rsquo;t fit for a normal day job. Upon graduating from Erasmus Hall in 1926, he kept true to that sentiment, working as a folk singer in Greenwich village while continuing to write.&nbsp; This same anti-establishment sentiment pushed him towards joining the Communist Party, where he and his future wife Joy Davidman would become active members.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With no set jobs or commitments in NYC, his leftist stance encouraged him to become a volunteer medic on the Loyalist side during the Spanish Civil War.&nbsp; While serving during the war, he by chance met a former sideshow employee named Joseph Daniel &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; Halliday.&nbsp; They became great friends, and bonded over the sideshow that was such a major influence on Gresham.&nbsp; Their long conversations would inspire Gresham&rsquo;s future works, particularly <em>Monster Midway </em>and <em>Nightmare Ally.&nbsp; </em>Gresham also tended to be a heavy drinker, being described as destructive and violent.&nbsp; While enlisted, Gresham attempted to hang himself with his belt, only surviving due to the hook in the wall giving way.&nbsp; He then returned to America in 1939 at the age of 30 after he contracted tuberculosis and was placed in the tuberculosis ward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The war had taken an immense toll on Gresham, and writing offered him therapeutic clarity. In 1946 he gained massive fame for his novel <em>Nightmare Ally, </em>a kind of autobiography where he describes a preacher&#39;s decline into a drunken carnival geek.&nbsp; But this recently gained fame was hard on Gresham, and he cracked under the pressure to write another successful novel.&nbsp; His drinking became worse, and he began to abuse both his children and his wife.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t deal with his continued failure and his lack of belonging, driving away both his wife and his children, with his wife leaving him to escape to the UK.&nbsp; He then turned back to his elusive carny dream, learning to eat fire, tell fortunes, and volunteering in a knife throwing act.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1962, his health had deteriorated beyond repair, and shortly after going partially blind he was diagnosed with tongue cancer.&nbsp; Diagnosed as terminal, Gresham was alone and dying, never having fulfilled his true dream of becoming a carny.&nbsp; On September 14, 1962 he checked into the Hotel Carter in Manhattan, where he would then commit suice by overdosing on sleeping pills.&nbsp; A writer, magician, and veteran, he was forgotten by New York, with his death only being noted by a single columnist.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Michael Sidorvich was born on July 6, 1916. He grew up and lived in New York City to a Jewish family, both of his parents being immigrants to America. He lived at 341 East 19th St in Gramercy Park, a neighborhood on the south end of Midtown. He attended Seward Park High School for an undetermined number of years, then transferred to Stuyvesant High School, an all-boys technical high school at the time, and underwent engineering training there. During his time at Seward Park, he became acquainted with a man named Julius Rosenberg. In 1934, Sidorovich became a member of the Young Communist League, an organization that taught its members about the ideas of Marx and about the ideology of communism as a whole. Rosenberg also joined the League, and rose to a higher position within the organization, choosing to spread the ideals of communism at home in America, while Sidorovich decided his efforts would be better served abroad.On October 23, 1937, Sidorovich left New York on the Champlain to Spain along with the rest of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, which had been training and fighting for months at that point. He landed in Spain on November 9, fighting in the 4th group, 35th battery of the Brigade, which was the anti-tank division. His division commander was Nathan Budish, an engineer from Minnesota who had served as an artillery officer in the US army reserves. The 35th Battery would see heavy fighting in Teruel, with Earnest Hemmingway himself there to report on it. The division would then fight in the Retreats through Aragon, and end up in Alcoi, a small outpost near Valencia. They saw intense combat defending the Levante Front, and managed to hold off the Nationalists during their offensive. Sidorovich returned to the US on February 4, 1939 aboard the President Harding after Barcelona fell and the war was hopeless. Years later, Sidorovich married Ann Sidorovich, who was a dressmaker and daughter of a Communist Party member Mikhail Tkach, who edited a Ukranian newspaper. The Sidorovichs lived at 10 Monroe Street in Knickerbocker Village, a group of apartments on the Lower East side between the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges, in the same building as his old friend Julius Rosenberg and his wife Ethel. In 1939, Sidorovich and Rosenberg would work at Williams Aeronautical Corporation, a company started by fellow Spanish Civil War veteran Paul Williams.Williams was born in Ohio, and became the only black pilot in the area for himself, had connections to the Soviet government, and became under investigation in the famous Rosenberg Trial, in which Julius and Ethel would be executed.&nbsp;time. After a few failed attempts to design and sell a plane to the government, he went to Spain to see if he could put his talents to work there &ndash; only to be told the army didn&rsquo;t need more pilots. He returned to the US after three months, and began teaching aviation courses under the umbrella of a communist aligned organization called the Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists, and Technicians. Michael and Ann Sidorovich, and Julius Rosenberg, all attended his classes and began working for him. The company, as well as Rosenberg himself.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Saul Wellman is a man who&rsquo;s entire life has been dedicated to revolution. From day one he fought for a better world and in his own words he wanted &ldquo;...things to change, where the playing field is leveled, where equality emerges as a reality...where the horrible things about inequality are eliminated.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWellman&rsquo;s story begins on August 18, 1913, Elizabeth, New Jersey. He was born to a Jewish mother who emigrated from the Russian Empire. His mother was an avid socialist and as Wellman himself put it, &ldquo;I suckled the ideas of socialism at my mother&rsquo;s breast.&rdquo; Shortly after his birth, he and his mother moved to 136 Pulaski Street in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn where Wellman attended Boys High School in Brooklyn. His rapidly developing political consciousness was put into high gear when his mother took him to see Eugene Debs speak when he was 14. From that point on, Saul Wellman&rsquo;s identity as an avid socialist and revolutionary was solidified. However, this was dangerous to be at the time since he grew up in the context of the Palmer raids and the first Red Scare during the 1920&rsquo;s. Wellman saw many of his mother&rsquo;s associates rooted out and arrested by DOJ spies and he himself was arrested when he attended a demonstration of 100,000 workers at Union Square in New York City. This earned him an expulsion from his school and he spent the next few years in limbo. His life found purpose again upon the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Hearing about the abuses of Jews in fascist Germany and the plight of the Popular Front government in Spain, he could not allow himself to stand by. He felt duty bound as a lifelong socialist to prevent the world from falling to fascist tyranny and so on April 28, 1937 he set sail aboard the Normandie, arriving in Spain on May 28, 1937. Being a politically active and knowledgeable individual, he was assigned as adjutant commissar to the Candadian MacKenzie-Papineau Brigade despite being an American himself. Unlike the portrayals of commissars in popular media as detached political bureaucrats who execute dissidents at a whim, the goal of the Republican Commiserate was to be Mother Hens.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Republican army was enthusiastic and patriotic but completely untrained in the ways of war. The commissar was supposed to make up for this and thus had several roles:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Create the spirit of discipline and loyalty to the Republican cause and establish comradery between officers and rank and file<br />\r\n-Be an educator, clarifying all political issues<br />\r\n-Act as a commanding officer during combat and ensure orders were being followed<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWellman fulfilled this role trying to help the material well-being and comfort of his men. He worried about everything from food to sanitation, nagging his superiors to give his men whatever supplies they could give.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWellman found himself in the thick of five major battles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe barely survived being used as a meat shield during Fuentes de Ebro where his brigade was thrown head first into the fascist advance in order to slow it down, muddying the ground with their own blood. Afterwards he took on the role of battalion commissar upon the death of his predecessor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe led his men through the meat grinder of Mas de Las Matas. After this he spent two week chasing down American cigarettes for his men, only to not be given them by the battalion&rsquo;s own inspector general.<br />\r\nWellman strove through the bitter snows of Teruel as it changed hands several times. During the final Republican holdout on El Muleton , he found himself pushed to the limit. Republican forces were on their last legs; they were outgunned, surrounded, stuck on an exposed hill with soil unusable for fortifications. The city below them filled with masses of fascists as Nationalist bombs and artillery blotted out the sun. Wellman ran from position to position as his ears rang from explosions, dust clawed at his throat and every step he took landed in a pool of his comrades&rsquo;s blood. Wherever he could, he led hold out actions, restored machine gun positions and tended to the wounded. Despite Republican valor, the fascist won the battle. This left Wellman to deal with a depleted and demoralized brigade suffering from a lack of supplies. Most notably, the skin of the soldiers started to crack due to a lack of oil so on his own initiative he arranged for several men to take a truck to Andorra and buy some oil. Four days later the men returned. As Wellman himself put it, &ldquo;No words were exchanged except a wink and a red front salute as [they] passed me a handful of nuts to replenish our depleted bodies.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs Wellman chowed down on nuts with his men, he never expected that in just a few days he would find himself fighting in the Retreats. Always running under a hail of fire, never looking back for fear of seeing a Moorish cavalryman behind him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWellman was critically wounded during the failed river crossing of the Ebro river which sealed the fate of the Republic. As fascist victory became inevitable, Wellman found himself on a ship going back to the USA. He arrived on December 20, 1938 aboard the Ausonia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite the failure in Spain, Wellman never gave up. As WWII broke out he signed up for the Army knowing that he must, for a fascist victory now meant fascist victory forever. He joined the ranks of the exalted 101st &ldquo;Screaming Eagles&rdquo; Airborne Division as an automatic rifleman and fought in Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge where he was critically wounded again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUpon returning back to home as a war hero, he got married and moved to Detroit. Here he resumed his political activities. Wellman joined the Communist Party, quickly rising to the top ranks, and took a job as a truck driver where he quickly began unionizing the workers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1949, he learned the hard way that history repeats itself as he was caught up in the Second Red Scare. Wellman was one of the Michigan Six that were tried under the Smith Act. He served six months in prison and broke with the Communist Party after he left as information about Stalin&rsquo;s atrocities reached the rest of the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite this he remained active as the de facto leader of the New-Left movement, having weekly breakfasts with movement figures and protesting wars from Vietnam to Iraq until his death on December 11, 2003.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>&ldquo;For me, going to Spain was closing a gap that had appeared in myself as a persona, which was tearing me apart.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abe Osheroff was born in Brooklyn in 1915 and grew up speaking Yiddish. Osheroff&rsquo;s political activism began at the age of twelve when he participated in a protest against the executions of two activists, Nicola Saco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, accused of killing a shoe company paymaster and a guard. At the age of sixteen he joined the Young Communist League, an organization aiming to develop its members into Communists through the study of Marxism and Leninism. A carpenter by trade, Osheroff became a prominent figure in his neighborhood of Brownsville, Brooklyn as a public speaker and for his activist organization of demonstrations and aid in resisting evictions in the neighborhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1931, Osheroff was arrested for moving furniture of evicted families back into their apartments. He was assaulted in prison by fascist-affiliated police officers that called him a &quot;dirty Communist Jew bastard.&quot; &quot;All of which was true,&quot; Osheroff said, &quot;except for the bastard part.&quot; This event inspired Osheroff to officially join the Communist Party. Osheroff occasionally ran into members of the IWW and admired them for their idealism but viewed their cause as hopeless. He graduated from the City College of New York and then went to Pennsylvania and Ohio to organize steel and coal workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Osheroff resisted the call to take up arms in a fight for the Spanish Republic for some time and was content to live in Brownsville with his girlfriend. Finally, newsreel footage of the Nazi Condor Legion terror bombing the Basque city of Guernica convinced him of the importance of fighting for the Republican side. Leaving his girlfriend behind, he sailed for France in May of 1937. Because the French had closed their border with Spain by this time, Osheroff was forced to take a boat from Marseille to Barcelona. Near the Spanish coast, Osheroff&rsquo;s boat was torpedoed by an Italian submarine. Osheroff managed to swim nearly two miles to shore on his own. Although most of the approximately 250 people on the boat had swam to shore or were picked up by anti-war Catalan fishermen, hoping that the submarine would not return to shoot them, approximately 80 of the passengers had drowned. By his account, Oshroff had no military experience before Spain except for hearing a revolver go off when he lived in a neighborhood with gang violence. Nonetheless, he claimed that it is conviction, not experience alone, that makes for a good soldier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abe served as a scout, an infantryman, and a mapmaker with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. He fought in the battles of Qinto Lochita and Fuentes de Ebro. In September of 1937, he fought in the Battle of Belchite near the city of Zaragoza in Aragon. As he tried to save a company of soldiers that had fallen behind in the trenches, machine-gun fire shattered his knee. After his injury, Osheroff returned to base to teach for a short time. He even managed to get into a fistfight with Ernest Hemingway over food Abe admitted he had been stealing from the writer. Narrowly dodging a court-marshalling by his superior officers and sick with typhoid, Osheroff fled to France as Franco&rsquo;s forces closed in. After returning to the US, Osheroff ran as a communist for New York legislature. During the height of the red scare and McCarthyism, he was forced to spend three years in hiding. On the outbreak of World War II, Osheroff enlisted in the army but was barred from going overseas based on his political views. &ldquo;We all volunteered for World War II,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To us, it was the same war [as the Spanish Civil War].&rdquo; Osheroff spent the war training troops in the South. He ultimately left the communist party in 1951 in response to persecution from the House of Un-American Activities and left New York at the same time and moved his family to the West Coast. After the war, he travelled throughout the South working on civil rights causes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He continued to pursue activism throughout his life, going to Nicaragua to construct housing and to the campus of the University of Washington and to meetings across Seattle to rally opponents of the war in Iraq in 2003. He protested the military dictatorships and wars in Vietnam, Guatemala, Indonesia, Chile and Panama. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;ve felt strongly about something, I&rsquo;ve felt a terrible need to do something about it or suffer loss of self respect,&rdquo; said Osheroff regarding his humanitarian work. Osheroff taught at the University of California-Los Angeles and at the University of Washington-Seattle and also traveled to other universities to deliver lectures. He had six children. In 1974, Osheroff made an award winning documentary film called &ldquo;Dreams and Nightmares&rdquo; in which he documented much of his youth and his experiences in Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From his work as a fighter against fascism in Spain, a trainer of troops to fight fascism in the Second World War, a builder of houses in Nicaragua, a protestor of war and dictatorship, a teacher, and a documentary film-maker, Abe Osheroff spent most of his life fighting against injustices wherever he saw them. He died on April 6th, 2008 in his home in Seattle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

He was married and lived at 2773 West 35th Street, Brooklyn, New York as a tailor under probation. Before deciding to fight the good fight. Hearing they were taking volunteers, he boarded President Roosevelt where he sailed as a part of the U.S navy. Sachs and the other volunteers entered Spain by traveling south through France and were smuggled in through the Pyrenees.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    After arriving in Spain in June 1937, Sachs received brief training by French officers. This lack of experience and training cost him and his comrades dearly in September of 1938. That morning they crossed the Ebro and proceeded on a three-day march with no food or water to the first town abandoned by the fascists as we approached. Sachs and his comrades found some food, cans of salty fish, but were unable to drink the water as the fascists had contaminated the wells. Tired, parched and hungry they moved on to Hill 666 a rocky height, completely barren of any vegetation due to the repeated bombardment; not enough soil to dig trenches, the parapets piled-up rock that added to the danger when struck by artillery shells. There, William Sachs, was killed in action at Sierra Caballs, Ebro Offensive.</p>\r\n    ",

        "data": "<p>Irving Peshkin, otherwise known as Frank Peshkin or Irving Peters was born on October 16th, 1906 in Slonim, Belarus, (part of Russia at the time) to Russian-Jewish parents. Because of his early life living in Russia during the revolution, Peshkin became a supporter of communism, eventually joining the Communist Party of The United States of America. This involvement also led to Peshkin being investigated by the United States Committee on the Judiciary for Soviet Activity. Peshkin moved to the upper east side of New York City before the 1930s, attending university, although it is not known exactly where he attended. After university, he became a typographer, a job that at the time was used to describe typewriting. Peshkin&rsquo;s work in the Communist Party was likely focused on writing documents.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause he supported communism, he decided to take part in the Spanish civil war, sailing aboard the Washington on March 10, 1937. He arrived in Spain seventeen days later and trained at Tarazona Training base from September to August of that year. Peshkin served at Huesca, Aragon, Teruel, Hegra, Belchite, Tortosa, and the Ebro Offensive. During the Ebro Offensive, Peshkin served in the 3rd Division, 60 BDE, Anti-tank Battery. Peshkin was not well-liked among other Lincoln battalion volunteers. In Huesca, it is noted by Ben Iceland that Peshkin bragged about the many fronts he had been at, and how he should have been sent back home. His attitude caused him to be despised by his fellow soldiers with Louis Elliott telling him &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t figure out how so many good guys get bumped off, and a co&ntilde;o [pussy] like you is still around; you&rsquo;ll probably go home and tell everybody what a hero you&rsquo;ve been in Spain.&rdquo; On the truck which was transporting the soldiers, Irving Peshkin got the most comfortable spot and made it more uncomfortable for everyone else. Leon Rosenburg, a fellow New Yorker, started to threaten Peshkin and call him names: &ldquo;You lazy son-of-a-bitch, co&ntilde;o, why don&rsquo;t you get yourself shot and become a hero. One of these days you&rsquo;ll wake up dead, and it&rsquo;ll be a good thing for everybody.&rdquo; Peshkin just smiled upon hearing this, wrapped a blanket around himself, and closed his eyes. Even if the other soldiers could get him to move, he would always be back to the best spot. Sometime later, near Belchite, Rosenberg, Peshkin, and Iceland began to work digging a foxhole themselves. Rosenberg started yelling at Peshkin for not having done his share of digging and threatening to throw him out if he dared to duck into any part of the foxhole when the time came to take cover. Peshkin said nothing, just smiled. He was used to being a scapegoat for the soldier&rsquo;s frustration. Sure enough, Peshkin was first in the foxhole they had dug, and Rosenberg and Iceland cursed and pummeled him to make some room for themselves. He did not listen and lay at the bottom of the trench, he said: &ldquo;What are you guys so scared about?&rdquo;. He returned to the United States on December 20, 1938, aboard the Ausonia. He lived in Jamaica Queens until his death at age sixty-nine in November of 1975.</p>\r\n",

She lived in Brooklyn for many years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBorn to a socialist Jewish mother, Ruth Davidow grew up surrounded by communist ideology. Her mother Maria, a leader of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, started taking her to picket rallies at the age of four. The 1917 Bolshevik Revolution further encouraged her mother&rsquo;s political involvement, which in turn encouraged Ruth greatly. The Bolshevik Revolution made many hopeful about a forthcoming end to anti-Semitism. Maria was active in propagating communism by distributing The Daily Worker, a communist newspaper, in the neighborhood. Ruth&rsquo;s father was essentially uninvolved in politics, but her mother served as an example for Ruth, as well as her brother and sister.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRuth dreamed of becoming a lawyer, but was forced out of school after her father&rsquo;s tuberculosis diagnosis. She took numerous odd jobs, prevented from attending law school by her family&rsquo;s poverty. She found out that there were no tuition fees required for nursing. So, she went on to enroll in nursing school at the Brooklyn Jewish Hospital. There, she felt like a cog in the machine with no say in any policy decisions. Still, by the early 1930&rsquo;s, Ruth was a registered nurse.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1936, she began to see many articles about the war in Spain. In 1937, because of debates held by the communist organizations she remained a part of, Ruth began to see the connection between the war in Spain and the fascist rules in Italy and Germany. At the time, FDR was following a policy of appeasement with the fascist nations. Ruth grew fed up with the government&rsquo;s inaction and enrolled in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAround this time, she was involved in many protests; there are photographs linking her to the Cigarettes for Spain Campaign on Sep 1, 1937 and the Washington, DC: Lift the Embargo Conference on Jan 9, 1939.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn June 1937, she set sail to Spain as part of the medical volunteer force. She endured many harsh conditions&ndash; working in caves and abandoned buildings and dealing with constant shortages of necessary supplies. She found that the Republicans were under-equipped and relied, in large, on the courage of their soldiers. She served with the Republican Medical Service; she was a nurse at Pozoblanco on the Cordoba Front and served on a Spanish Surgical Team during the Ebro Offensive. In an audio recording in the Tamiment archives, Davidow recounts seeing soldiers practicing for the Ebro offensive every day and complaining about its futility. In her words, this was when the doctors and nurses started dealing with problems like tonsils and ingrown toenails and hernias because they finally had had the time and the opportunity to do so.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a nurse, she cared deeply about her patients. In the interview, she recounts a time she found out a doctor was getting special care packages with delicacies like goose liver and chocolate. She got into the packages and handed the food out to her patients to aid with their recovery.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe returned to America on December 1, 1938 on the Queen Mary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDavidow remained a pivotal figure after the war, becoming a prominent figure of the Veterans of the Brigade. She settled in San Francisco and married Fred Keller. She went on to have one daughter: Joanie Keller Selznick. After the war, she kept fighting, joining numerous activist organizations. She helped with the Public Health Organization, the Freedom Riders, and the Native American occupation of Alcatraz. She worked in Cuba for over a year, helping with the public health system. She helped with the founding of a health clinic in San Francisco to help with drug addiction. She also spoke about her experience in Spain often; she visited Duke University in March 1939 with Evelyn Hutchins Rahman to speak to students about her experience in the war.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHer daughter became a filmmaker. In the 1980&rsquo;s, with her daughter&rsquo;s encouragement, Ruth started making documentaries to protest for the causes she believed in. She ended up creating 21 films. She was also filmed in projects such as The Good Fight: The Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil War (1984) and Forever Activists: Stories from the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (1990).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1997, at the age of 85, Davidow returned to Spain for a reunion of the International Brigade, and was made an honorary citizen by the Spanish government.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe was deeply engaged in political activism her entire life, until her death in 1999 at age 87.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Melvin M. Ofsink was born on September 13th, 1910 in New York City to Jewish parents. He spoke both English and Yiddish. After graduating high school, Ofsink had aspirations to be a lawyer. He attended St. John&rsquo;s Law and graduated in 1932 after he earned a bachelor of laws degree. He was a practicing lawyer and one of the earliest members of the National Lawyers Guild. He was a legal staff member who worked at the International Labor Defense. Ofsink was a registered member of the Communist Party of New York. He was unmarried and lived alone in a two-story house located at 1035 Hegeman Avenue, Brooklyn NY.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>After almost five years of practicing law, Ofsink decided to fight for the Republic side in the Spanish Civil War. He was determined to fight off the fascists and was one of the many Jews that served in the Abraham Lincoln Battalion. Ofsink was issued a passport on January 5th, 1937. His passport number was 361878. It took him 11 days to arrive in Spain aboard the <em>Paris. </em>He arrived in Spain in February 1937.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ofsink served as part of the land army of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion and was ranked a Teniente, which translates to a lieutenant in English. He served in the Battle of Jarama. While fighting at the Battle of Brunete, Ofsink was severely wounded on July 13th, 1937. He went to train at the Officers Training School at Tarazona. He was discharged from the training school on September 13, 1937. Ofsink was known as very reliable among his comrades and had a good record in Spain. According to his superior&rsquo;s remarks, Ofsink was reliable, disciplined and worked well with other men. He was seen as &ldquo;an extra good&rdquo; political influence among his comrades. Ofsink was reported Missing in Action on April 3rd, 1938 near Gandesa. It is presumed that he died on that day.</p>\r\n    ",

        "data": "<p>Edward Albin Dunos was born in New Jersey on February 10th, 1910, the year future president Woodrow Wilson became governor of the state. During his childhood, the Titanic sank on its maiden voyage, Wilson was elected President of the United States, and World War I began and ended. At some point between his birth and his departure to Spain in 1938, he moved to New York City.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, Dunos may have already moved to New York City. However, he could not have joined the war until he received his passport in July of 1938, which marks his address as NYC. In 1938, the city was in the midst of recovery from the Great Depression, just having suffered a year-long recession but slowly benefiting from Roosevelt&rsquo;s Works Progress Administration, which funded public works and employed thousands in NYC. By 1938, New York state was also home to 38,000 Communist party members, hundreds of Young Communist League members, and thousands of students across various Communist groups. It was in this political and economic climate that, only months before the withdrawal of the International Brigades from battle, Dunos became part of the Lincoln-Washington Battalion of the 15th International Brigade (a.k.a. the Abraham Lincoln Brigade).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDunos&rsquo; integrated battalion of 3,015 men was a combination of the original Lincoln Battalion plus the newly trained Washington Battalion. The battalion had already had a hard run of things, with only two months of training, heavy losses in 1937&rsquo;s Battle of Jarama and the offensive at &ldquo;Mosquito Ridge,&rdquo; and losing Teruel to Nationalist forces in 1938. They did have a few victories, however, such as in the Brunete Offensive of 1937 in which they took a municipality northwest of Madrid called Villanueva de la Ca&ntilde;ada, and when they successfully attacked Nationalist fortifications at Segura de los Ba&ntilde;os, a province of Teruel. Before Dunos&rsquo; time, the battalion had contained notable figures like Moe Fishman&mdash;a Young Communist League member, anti-Fascist, WWII veteran, and volunteer who provided aid to refugees of Spain under Franco&mdash;and Oliver Law&mdash;one of the earliest volunteers, the first African American in U.S. history to lead an integrated military force, a captain during the Brunete Offensive, and a casualty of &ldquo;Mosquito Ridge.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn March of 1938, when the battalion was meant to be resting in Aragon, they were instead divided and reunited repeatedly as Nationalist forces cut the Republic in half. Most of the battalion&rsquo;s members were killed, captured, or missing. Slowly, the battalion rebuilt with limited international volunteers and many Spanish troops. This is likely when Dunos joined the war as one of the few American volunteers to arrive after September 1937; he received his passport on July 18th, 1938, mere days before the Ebro Offensive began on July 25th.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Battle of Ebro was the longest and largest battle of the war, fought mostly in lower Catalonia and Aragon. Dunos was part of the Ebro Army&rsquo;s 35th International Division (led by Commander Pedro Mateo Merino) of the 15th Army Corps (led by officer Manuel Tag&uuml;e&ntilde;a). He probably had received only days of training before being placed into the Army Corps.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEarly on July 25th, led by a Hungarian battalion, Dunos and his division crept towards the Ebro River near the Catalonian village of Asc&oacute;, then boated across it to the muddy banks on the other side. After the successful crossing, they mostly fell victim to the Nationalists&rsquo; superior forces. However, the Republicans managed for a while to hold on to their position in Sierra de Cavalls, a mountain chain in Catalonia where Dunos ended up after crossing the Ebro. Unfortunately, in early September, the Nationalists resumed an attack that allowed them a breakthrough in Sierra de Cavalls; though they were pushed back with Republican reinforcements, this is probably when Dunos died.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost likely, on September 7th, 1938, at age 28, he was captured and killed by Nationalist forces, yet another young American soldier struck down in the noble fight against Fascism. It is possible that, based on Comintern documents, he was wounded or fell ill around August 4th, 1938, put in a medical facility, then discharged and sent back into battle (the documents, which are in handwritten, partly legible French, contain words like &ldquo;scar,&rdquo; &ldquo;bubonic,&rdquo; and &ldquo;slightly enlarged liver&rdquo;). Two weeks after his death, Spanish prime minister Juan Negr&iacute;n announced that the International Brigades were being withdrawn from battle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote: In 1973, a large fire at the National Personnel Records Center in Missouri destroyed 80% of the records of Army personnel discharged from November 1, 1912 to January 1, 1960. It is uncertain whether any information on Dunos would be in these records because he may have illegally gone to Spain to fight (as many American volunteers did since the American government did not support their efforts) and/or because he was killed rather than discharged. However, if the Records Center did have any information on Dunos, it was likely destroyed.</p>\r\n",

A month later, she helped set up the first American hospital in Romeral. In a letter from July addressed to &quot;T,&quot; she states, &quot;My first operating room was set up in Romeral, and what a problem! No running water; water had to be carried in the house after we had pulled it up from a well, and then was placed in tanks for scrubbing. Water had to be carried in for the autoclaves, etc. Our autoclaves are heated by prima stoves which run on kerosene, and you can&rsquo;t imagine how much work there is attached to sterilizing and keeping things clean. We spend hours trying to figure out a way in which to sterilize our goods so that things come out dry. We have not given up trying although we have been at it five months.&quot; Most of her letters were sent to her family from Spain, and usually depicted detailed descriptions of her work and surroundings. She served throughout Spain, setting up operating rooms in Villa Paz, Teruel, the Aragon Front, Belchite, Gandesa, and Cuevas Labradas. Regarding her experience treating the troops, she once stated, &quot;What right had I to be frightened? I who have just tasted what they have long lived through? With my heart pounding almost as loudly as the roar of the motors aboe, I spoke to them. I told them they must be brave.&quot; These statements were often published in radical papers and helped label the American Medical Brigade members as heroes. Upon her return to the United States in 1938, Taft continued to communicate with individuals in Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a documentary called &quot;Into the Fire: American Women in the Spanish Civil War,&quot; another volunteer named Helen Freeman recalled, &quot;I met some friends and went to a meeting. And the meeting was called to aid Spanish democracy. All the different unions were supporting the group. They asked for nurses and doctors and volunteers to go to Spain. And so, I volunteered. They called us in and started organizing the trip. Meeting with the different people who were going, like Fredericka Martin, Lini DeVries, and my friend Anne Taft, who graduated from the same school that I did. People had to resign from their jobs. Most of us were young nurses. And so, that&rsquo;s why they had meetings to teach the young people what to expect when they get over there.&quot; She was documented to be the head nurse later on in her life and continued similar activities even after returning to New York by serving as a spokesperson for a fundraising drive that sent an American relief ship with food, clothing, and supplies to Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnne Taft married Dr. Leon F. Muldavin in New York City, and remained with him in the city throughout their lives. She passed away in 1990 in New York City.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Paolino Sarti was born on the twenty-first of May, 1908 in S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil. His parents, who were farmers, had been part of the wave of Italians who immigrated to Brazil in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His mother died when he was young, and his older sister moved away shortly afterwards to get married, so Sarti grew up without a mother figure. His family moved back to Italy after he was born, and that is where his childhood took place.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the age of 18, in the city of Genoa in Northern Italy, Sarti boarded the SS Conte Biancamano, bound for New York City. He arrived on the 11th of March, 1927, declaring intentions of establishing permanent residence and citizenship. His final destination was Chicago, Illinois. During his time in Chicago, he picked up English, as well as a job in a stationery factory.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1931 in the midst of the Great Depression, Sarti&rsquo;s workmate was to be fired. Sarti volunteered himself in his place out of altruism--his workmate had a family and he did not. Following the loss of his job, Sarti moved to New York City in search of better prospects. He was unemployed for six to seven months, and was forced to sleep on park benches and in subway cars. Eventually, he was able to secure a job as a waiter, and moved into an apartment in Greenwich Village. But Sarti was deeply disaffected by his experiences with unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, and was drawn towards leftist political groups and unions, including the International Workers Order, Italian Workers&rsquo; Club, and Friends of the Soviet Union. In 1934, he joined the Communist Party USA, a Comintern-affiliated group based in New York City. He was active in the party, selling their paper, the <em>Daily Worker</em>, on the street, &ldquo;breaking up a fascist reception,&rdquo; and participating in street demonstrations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1937, feeling a sense of moral duty, Paolino Sarti made the decision to travel to Spain. With a false Spanish passport, a nom de guerre, &ldquo;Paulino Sala Perez,&rdquo; and help from the Italian Communist Party bureau, he arrived in Albacete on October 22nd. He had travelled by steamship and railroad. He cited his reason for making the journey and facing the possibility of ultimate sacrifice as simply &ldquo;to fight against fascism.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sarti joined the 1st Company of the Lincoln Battalion. He served at the front in Teruel and then in Seguro de los Ba&ntilde;os, a small village to the north, from January 1st of 1938 (about two weeks after the battle began) until February 15th of the same year, when he was wounded in the leg while advancing on a fortified Nationalist position, becoming one of the 85,000 casualties at that brutal battle. After being injured, Sarti was flown to the Red Cross base in Catalonia for treatment. After surgery and recovery, he was declared no longer fit for active military service, and was reassigned as brigade guard. Throughout his time in Spain, Paolino Sarti received overwhelmingly positive reports from his commanders. He was called &ldquo;of the best&#39;&#39;, &ldquo;disciplined, steady, brave&rdquo;, and &ldquo;a very good antifascist.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In late October 1938, as the war neared its end and the inevitability of a Nationalist victory became clearer, Sarti began expressing a desire to be repatriated to the United States. Although the US government did not have knowledge of his membership to the Communist Party, he was concerned that he would be unable to return because of his having assumed an alias. It is unclear exactly how he got back to the United States, but upon arrival he returned to his apartment at 349 West 4th St and his job as a waiter. Two years later, on the 17th of October, 1940, he and Yolanda Moriconi were married.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once all the information about the Americans who had illegally travelled to Spain came out, Sarti became acutely aware of the possibility of being deported. To ensure this didn&rsquo;t happen, he enlisted in the Navy during World War II, serving on the USS Alaska, and receiving praise for his conduct once again. Sarti had a child, Bob, who was born while he was still serving in the war.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite his incredible accomplishments, service, activism, and strong convictions, Paolino Sarti did not speak of politics at home. In fact, he kept Spain a secret, including from his children. This was due to the widespread (but not misplaced) fear that characterized the McCarthy Era, and the very strong implications of Sarti&rsquo;s time in Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his life after the Spanish Civil War, there were two things that were most important to Paolino Sarti: family and education. Despite the fact that he had not been formally educated past primary school, it was never even a question that his son would go to college (he did).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paolino Sarti, who loved gardens, pinochle, Chesterfields, and anti-fascism, died on November 28th, 1956, and is buried in the Long Island National Cemetery.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Benjamin Sills or as many called him, Ben Sills, was born on May 19, 1913 in Brooklyn. He lived at 438A Monroe Street in Bed Stuy and was of Jewish ancestry. He went to high school, most likely in his neighborhood, and attended the City College of New York (CCNY). CCNY is a public research university in West Harlem. At the time Sills was enrolled, it was completely free and pretty competitive to attend, with the school often being referred to as &ldquo;the poor man&rsquo;s Harvard.&rdquo; Yet Sills did not graduate; instead in his senior year, he became a seaman and sailed the Gulf Region. It was his time working as a sailor that radicalized Sills. On the high seas, he experienced low pay, long hours, and almost inedible food. He&rsquo;d watch as his colleagues and companions wrestled to form new unions and often ended up being beaten or fired&mdash;or both. Sills joined multiple unions, mainly the Industrial Workers of the World, the Sailors&rsquo; Union of the Pacific, and the National Maritime Union. Eventually, on May 15, 1935, Sills would also join the Communist Party. It was not unusual for a sailor to be as radical as Sills was and many of his fellow seamen were also Communists, or at least Leftists.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSills heard about Franco&rsquo;s initial uprising in 1936, but it wasn&rsquo;t until July 13, 1937, that Sills sailed to Spain on a ship named the Berengaria. It wasn&rsquo;t a very difficult decision for Sills to join the war. You see, he knew he had the strength from sailing to be able to succeed in battle, but it wasn&rsquo;t only that. Once his own unions had succeeded well enough, Sills felt it was his duty to help thwart the fascism he believed to be directly opposed to the formation of worker&rsquo;s unions. Sills knew he had to go to Spain to protect future workers&#39; rights all over the world. He was not the only sailor who felt this way. After all, the National Maritime Union reports that 500 seamen went to Spain to fight in the war. These sailors were the largest group of workingmen to join the battle in Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSills arrived in Spain on July 21, 1937. He found himself in Setcases. Sills had never been in Spain before and was dazzled by his new surroundings. Yet, he didn&rsquo;t have long to appreciate Spain&rsquo;s beauty before he was pulled into the action that had brought him there in the first place. After a difficult journey in Spain&rsquo;s July heat, Sills and other members of the XV Brigade arrived at said action: the battles of Quinto and Belchite. In fact, Sills had only been in Spain for a total of only six days before he began fighting at Quinto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe town of Quinto was located on the edge of the Ebro River Valley and was composed of hundreds of adobe buildings loomed over by a large stone church. The Lincoln Battalion&rsquo;s objective was to take over the Nationalist-run town. This was necessary because Quinto was one of two last strong points between the Republicans taking control of Zaragoza. The battle of Quinto ended with a final Nationalist stand in the large stone church and by August 27, the Republicans had control of Quinto.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for Belchite, in order to gain control of the town, the Republicans first had to find a way to get into Belchite from their trenches a couple of hundred yards outside. As fighting ensued, the town was practically destroyed, yet the battalion still found itself unable to fully take the town. Soon the battalion decided to break into groups. Sills&rsquo;s group was still stuck on the outside of the walls surrounding the town, but they crawled towards a factory next to the town&rsquo;s church. As they hid by the church&#39;s doors, anti-tank guns only a few hundred yards away fired into the factory. The noise was enough to hurt Sills&#39;s ears more than they&rsquo;d ever hurt before and the ground shook beneath him. Yet Sills did not lose his bravery. When the firing ceased, he stood up, throwing a hand grenade into the factory and shoving open the large doors he had just been cowering against. To his surprise, the factory was empty. There were no Nationalists to be found. But Sills did not have time to feel his relief; he was still trembling from the impact of the anti-tank guns. He would not stop trembling for at least two more days. Eventually, the Republicans would win this battle and Sills&rsquo;s trembling would fade as he went on to fight in Fuentes de Ebro, Teruel, Segura de los Ban\u0303os, and the Retreats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThough Sills&rsquo;s time in Spain was not only battles. There were lulls in which the Battalion would focus on training. In July 1938, a year after Sills had first arrived, his battalion rested in the village of Vilella Alta and continued to train to recross the Ebro. By this point, Sills had become a Company One commissar of the Special Machine Gun Battalion. Sills stayed with a kind host family called the Paramons and shared a room with Len Levenson, a fellow soldier who he had first met when they attended City College of New York together. Even with the intensity of training and the summer heat, Sills&rsquo;s stay in Vilella Alta turned out to be rather nice. Even through the stress of preparing to fight again, he was able to appreciate the region&rsquo;s wine, olives, beautiful countryside views, and, of course, the Paramons&rsquo; rather funny-looking donkey.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSills returned home from Spain on December 15, 1938, as hopes of a Republican victory diminished. Sills would&rsquo;ve stayed for longer if he could have, but all international soldiers on the Republican side were sent home after the Retreats. The Retreats had been difficult for Sills&rsquo;s battalion, not only did they suffer a military defeat, but it was also greatly demoralizing. Yet, in October 1938, Sills and his men were able to put aside their lowered morale for the farewell parade for international soldiers in Barcelona. All in all, the parade felt like a last hurrah that Sills could get behind as he and his men were regrettably forced to leave Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven though Sills had been unsuccessful in thwarting fascism in Spain, that would not stop him from rejoining the fight against fascism in the 1940s during World War II. For the rest of Sills&#39;s life, until his death of old age on August 5, 1982, he continued to do whatever he believed needed to be done to protect workers&#39; rights against the threats of fascism. Even now, when his former Bed-Stuy home has been torn down and rebuilt as an elementary school and the Pamarons have replaced their donkey with a tractor, Ben Sills&rsquo;s legacy lives on. He is remembered by those who knew him, but he is most often remembered without a name. Sills was one of the few brave Americans in the late 1930s who was willing to do something. Sills was willing to risk his own life to stand up against fascism. As time goes on, it&rsquo;s important we continue to remember men like Ben Sills.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Robert Haslan was born in New York City on May 25, 1915. He had a relatively small family and grew up in an apartment in Upper Manhattan at 25 Fort Washington Avenue with his father, Paul Haslan, brother, William Haslan, and mother (name unknown). Prior to deciding to volunteer for the war, Haslan had recently finished high school and was beginning to study art at a night school that was offering lessons in a nearby neighborhood. For income, he had been working on-and-off since he was 14&mdash;mostly odd jobs like clerical work and serving at cafes&mdash;and had also pursued a side career as an artist. Additionally, Haslan spent a year and a half with the Works Progress Administration (WPA). The WPA was one of the New Deal agencies created during the Second New Deal that provided paid jobs in sectors like infrastructure to the unemployed during the Great Depression. Through the WPA, Haslan became a part of the City Projects Council and had also joined the Workers Alliance of America (WAA).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The WAA had opened Haslan up to a lot more Communist ideas as he felt himself sympathizing with fellow members and frequently participating in the labor movement that was going on at the time in New York City. He then joined the Communist party in November of 1936&mdash;a decision which likely influenced his perspective towards the political atmosphere overseas and spurred him to volunteer for the war when time came.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He received his passport on June 29, 1937, and shortly left for Spain aboard the President Roosevelt ship on July 7, 1937. However, partially because of the U.S. government&rsquo;s adamant neutrality regarding the war, the President Roosevelt couldn&rsquo;t take the volunteers straight to Spain. After an 8 day journey across the Atlantic, Haslan arrived in Havre, France on July 15th, where he then boarded the Espolla&mdash;the ship that would bring him and 50 other men across the border&mdash;and arrived in Spain on July 24th. During this time, he often assumed the alias&rsquo; &ldquo;Bob Haslan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Robert Haslam&rdquo; in records like lists and letters for confidentiality purposes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once he got situated, Haslan spent about six weeks training with a very diverse unit in the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion alongside international volunteers from countries like Belgium, Canada, France, Poland, Italy, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. He was then transferred out from the training base in Tarazona to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in November 1937 before being put into action on the Aragon and Tereul fronts with the Lincoln-Washington Battalion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whilst fighting at the Teruel front, Haslan had bruised his knee and&mdash;he claimed this was mainly due to the dampness of the environment&mdash;it had become swollen and inflamed. Too painful to continue, he was sent to the hospital to have it cut open. Haslan was quick to mention in a letter written on March 2, 1938 from Albacete to a friend back home that it had healed relatively quickly and he was hoping &ldquo;to be rejoining the battalion soon.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For better or worse, Haslan soon got what he hoped for as he was put back on the frontlines during the Aragon Offensive&mdash;a military campaign focused on defeating the Republican troops in that area (which were weakened from the Battle of Teruel). Nationalists who advanced from the north with the Army of Africa, flanked by the Condor Legion as well 47 artillery batteries, easily held the upper hand against the already-depleted Republican troops. The battalion was then forced to abandon their positions during what is known as the Retreats, where Haslan unfortunately, was killed in action on April 4, 1938.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though he died early in the war, there is no doubt that Haslan deeply valued his time in Spain, writing in a letter that he went &ldquo;through good experiences here, experiences which are difficult to relate or describe, but they do take their place in the development of one&#39;s character and understanding.&rdquo; When asked in a questionnaire what the most outstanding thing he had experienced since leaving the U.S. was, Haslan marvelled at the experience of &ldquo;being able to take part in the high political awareness of the people of Spain,&rdquo; because &ldquo; they unite for progress and against racism and fascism. &ldquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through what little he left behind, Haslan has made his values evident. He held an &ldquo;undying hatred for fascism&rdquo; and had gone to Spain as a Communist willing to lay his life down to stop its spread. Perhaps more unexpectedly, Haslan had also developed an affinity for the country and the camaraderie it united in the process. Had he survived, Haslan intended to remain in Spain indefinitely and continue his art studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

At some point in his life, he came to live in New York City (specifically, 228 West 111th Street in Harlem), and at the age of 24, he decided to enlist to go fight in Spain. After obtaining a passport on March 29, 1937, he left New York aboard the Aquitania (an ocean liner that was sailing from New York to Cherbourg and Southampton) just 2 days later. Following his arrival in Spain (presumably coming from Cherbourg along with several other volunteers who also departed New York aboard the Aquitania on March 31st) in April, he eventually became the secretary of his company within the Lincoln Battalion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn July 6th, 1937, the Lincoln, Washington, and British Battalions were sent to serve as part of the offensive at Brunete against the Nationalists. They were sent to capture the town of Villanueva de la Ca&ntilde;ada and ended up spending the entire day engaged in a brutal struggle that was ultimately inconclusive. They were sent back to break the stalemate at the town the next day, and although they did manage to take the town, they suffered heavy casualties. Among those casualties was Van der Roest, who was killed during an attack by Nationalist aircraft. His demise was personally witnessed by Carl Syvanen, a fellow member of the Lincoln Battalion who would go on to recount the story in the Finnish novel Meid&auml;n Poikamme Espanjassa (Our Boys in Spain).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInterestingly enough, Van der Roest is claimed as a member of both the Lincoln Battalion and the Canadian-centric Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion: he was killed before ever getting the chance to join the &quot;Mac-Paps&quot; (as Syvanen later would) but is still listed among those Canadians who gave their life in service of the Republic (it is unclear whether or not he would have wanted to be remembered as a Canadian or an American, but his hometown is still remembered as New York).</p>\r\n",

It is unclear how she lost her father, but Leight was raised only by her mother and grew up hearing Yiddish folktales from a book dating all the way back to the 16th century. Her mother used these stories to encourage compassion towards others in their community. Leight&rsquo;s family was filled with suffragists and labor organizers. They inspired her to fight for what she believed in and to support different causes. When Leight got older, she used what her mother had taught her and studied to become a nurse at Bellevue Hospital. She successfully graduated in 1927. Leight got her passport on May 4, 1934 so that she could serve in the Spanish Civil War. She became a nurse in the army in March of 1937 after she sailed aboard Ile de France. Her family supported Leight&lsquo;s decision when she volunteered. In fact, she received much support and encouragement from her loved ones back at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nWhen Leight was in the army, she was single, and her address was 531 East 84th Street in New York. She served with the Republican Medical Services at Villa Paz hospital. Leight was also part of the American Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy (AMBASD). As a nurse in the war, she served as an interpreter and colleague to a nurse named Margaret Sanger. As they visited hospitals and clinics in the Soviet Union, Leight remarked how condoms and other such things were not allowed to be distributed by Sanger. She noticed the backward ways of the place she was born in. Leight came from a background of suffragists, so she understood the sexism displayed in those actions. Eventually, she was promoted to first lieutenant in the Federal Government Nursing service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nLeight returned home in August, 1937 aboard the Queen Mary.

        "data": "<p>Lawrence McCullough was born in Elmsford, New York, which is a village considered part of the town of Greenburgh in Westchester County. Born on February 12, 1907, McCullough was brought into a village that had yet to be incorporated. At the time of its incorporation, June 9, 1910, Elmsford was considered a Village of the IV Class, categorized as a village with a population of less than a thousand residents.<br />\r\nThe name McCullough has uncertain origins, some sources say that it is Irish, some say Scottish. The name itself has many possible etymological origins. One of the more commonly known/believed ones is from the Old Scots Gaelic &quot;MacCulloch&quot; or &quot;MacC(h)ullach&quot;, meaning son of Cullach, or boar. Another is the possible Irish translation of the name to the &ldquo;son of the hound of Ulster&rdquo;. With both the Irish and Scottish McCullough populations in such proximity to each other, I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that Lawrence McCullough has his roots in that general area as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHis predecessors then have multiple possible times and reasons for moving to America, more specifically New York and the surrounding areas. The first Scottish immigrants were aboard the Mayflower and came with the first English settlers to the New World. If he is of Irish descent, his family likely arrived with the wave of Irish immigrants during The Great Famine. More than half a decade before his birth, there was already a massive population of Irish Americans in New York. Nearly 25% of the city&rsquo;s residents were Irish, and the total number of Irish in New York was higher than in Dublin, the capital of Ireland. Those who were entering the city were most often Catholic and faced discrimination from the Protestant immigrants from Britain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOn June 14, 1937, at 30 years old, Lawrence McCullough received his passport. His address at the time was listed as 507 West Jane St in the West Village. This was a boarding house, the American Seamen&#39;s Friend Society Sailors&#39; Home and Institute, which is now called the Jane Hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nLess than four weeks later, McCullough sailed aboard the SS President Roosevelt, an ocean liner in service during the 1920s and 1930s. The SS President Roosevelt was originally built at the end of WWI as a Harris-class attack transport, its purpose was to deliver troops and equipment to hostile shores. After arriving in Spain on July 22, 1937, he served in Quinto and Belchite. After that, he was shot in the shoulder while fighting toward the end of the battle of Belchite, which was part of the Republican offensive to capture the capital of Aragon, Zaragoza, led by Francisco Franco. This battle lasted from August 24 to September 7, 1937, and destroyed the town. The battle of Belchite involved around 180,000 soldiers and ended with more than 11,000 casualties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe then went AWOL, like many of his comrades throughout the war, and was jailed after punching an officer while AWOL. He served 84 days of jail time from April 25, 1938, to July 18, 1938. This was after his best friend, Vernon Romayne Shelby was killed in action around April 6, 1938. While we don&#39;t know if those two events are correlated, it is a possible reason why McCullough went AWOL. He then rejoined as a member of the Lincoln-Washington Brigade in September of 1938. On September 21, 1938, Juan Negr&iacute;n, the Spanish prime minister announced that the Brigade would withdraw from battle in hopes that the Nationalists would be pressured into withdrawing as well. It is unclear as to if McCullough returned to the brigade after or before the announcement. After that, he was likely sent to Ripoll with the rest of the surviving Americans, and his nationality was verified by the International Red Cross and the US government, before finally returning to the US aboard the Ausonia on December 20, 1938.<br />\r\nHe passed away in Hialeah, Florida on January 17, 1988, at 80 years old.</p>\r\n",

He attended public school in China where basic military training was provided before immigrating to the United States at around 20 years old to work. Like most immigrants, he may have left China for more opportunities. He lived at 258 W. 55th Street on the Upper West Side working as both a waiter and a cook. From there, he joined the Spanish Civil War on June 12, 1937 and served with the XV BDE (the Abraham Lincoln Brigade). It&rsquo;s likely he took part in the war because he was a Communist, and believed in the Republic&rsquo;s cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter joining the war, he realized that there weren&rsquo;t many Chinese soldiers. He has seen only eight other Chinese soldiers, and none of them were in his squad. In a letter to another soldier, he says he wished he had someone to talk to in Chinese. For a lot of Chinese soldiers who volunteered to fight, they believed in the saying &ldquo;\u56db\u6d77\u4e00\u5bb6&rdquo; which directly translate to &ldquo;four seas one family,&rdquo; that something on the other side of the world was also something that he can be and is part of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn September 1937, there was one account of him getting injured mentioned in the La Vanguardia, a Spanish daily newspaper. Yick was shot in the right foot and through his toe and went to a hospital in Benicassim. After removing his big toe, he said he was determined to go right back to the battlefield and join the front lines. He went missing in the battle of Gandesa, and was assumed dead on April 3, 1938 at the age of 24.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter his death, surviving soldiers say they don&rsquo;t know Yick&rsquo;s real name, or where he was from, but remembered that he spoke fluent English, suggesting that he may have been from New York City. An investigator later asked around in Chinatown, NYC before finding an elderly man who says he recognized Yick. Once the elderly man was shown a picture of the soldier, he was sure that the soldier was Chen Wenrao from Guangzhou, confirming the soldier&rsquo;s real name and background.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Jerry Weinberg (also known as Gerald Weinberg and Jerry Warren) was a Jewish orphan whose date of birth is unknown. He also had a sister named Estelle. He went to Brooklyn College for a year before going off to Spain to fight in the Spanish Civil War. He fought as a member of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade against the fascist forces of General Francesco Franco and the Nationalists on February 6th, 1937. He received his passport on February 2nd, 1937, which revealed that he was 23 years old and lived in Brooklyn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAs a member of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, he was present when Oliver Law (the first black commander of an American Military Unit) died at the battle for Mosquito Ridge. As Law recklessly charged towards the heavily fortified fascists, he was gunned down almost instantly. Weinberg crawled to Law, pulling him to safety, and removed Law&rsquo;s boots from his feet. However, Law died less than an hour later, according to fellow Brigade member Harry Fisher. Law&rsquo;s death, however, is subject to controversy. One story claims that he died from enemy fire (the official story). The other (an unofficial story told by William Herrick, another Brigade member) states that he was shot by a black Brigade member who thought Law was behaving recklessly and endangered the brigade. He then paints Jerry as a looter who stole Law&rsquo;s belt and boots after slashing the aforementioned boots. However, it is widely agreed that Herrick&rsquo;s story was a lie, despite the fringe groups who believe it to be the truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter the Spanish Civil War, Weinberg became a bombardier on a B-24 Bomber in World War II. As a bombardier, he earned a Distinguished Flying Cross for participating in the Bombing Raids of Ploesti Oil Fields in Romania. Weinberg said that the action &ldquo;made up for&rdquo; Spain, alluding to how the Brigade and the left failed to prevent the rise of Francesco Franco and his Nationalists in Spain. During the Ploesti Oil Field Raids, rather than landing in neutral Turkey and staying in safe detention, he instead chose to escape by flying over Egypt, reaching England and so that he may continue to fight as a bombardier. Sadly this is where his story ends, when October 30th, 1943, he died flying over Germany.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Robert Bruce Rogers was born on April 13, 1907, in Girard, Kansas. Girard was a hotbed of socialism, especially as the home of the Appeal to Reason, which became the most circulated socialist newspaper in American history. Rogers&rsquo;s parents were members of the Socialist community in Girard, where Eugene V. Debs was active from 1907-1909. Rogers&rsquo;s father Bruce Rogers wrote an introduction to a 1908 biography of Debs distributed by the Appeal to Reason, criticizing what he saw as incessant oppression of the working class.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRogers became a painter, influenced by Modernist and Impressionist artists such as Frank DuMond and George Bridgman. He later moved to Provincetown, MA during the early 1930s, which is located on the furthest tip of Cape Cod. Provincetown had by that point become attractive to many artists due to the rather cheap costs of acquiring studios, and the incredible geographical surroundings. Rogers himself secured a studio at 447 Commercial Street. He studied under painter Hans Hofmann, who had established an art school in Provincetown in 1934. Rogers produced many landscapes of Provincetown&rsquo;s seaside views, and the general sights of the town.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRogers later moved to New York City, with an address at 53 Irving Place, in Gramercy Park near Union Square. He was a member of the Communist Party and the United American Artists CIO union. He was also a member of the UOPWA (United Office and Professional Workers of America), formed in 1937, and an extremely Communist-dominated union. It is likely that through these interactions Rogers developed his opinions on the civil war in Spain, and influenced his decision to eventually go there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRogers arrived in Spain on August 24, 1938, quite late in the conflict; he was likely the last American volunteer to see combat. Joining the XV Brigade Lincoln-Washington Battalion, he served during the Republic&rsquo;s attempted Ebro Offensive. Although prime minister Juan Negrin declared the withdrawal of all international forces on September 21, 1938, his unit still fought afterwards. Rogers was wounded in action on September 23, getting shot in the abdomen. The rest of his time in Spain was spent in hospitals, until the RMS Ausonia took him back to the United States with fifty other American volunteers, arriving by December 20 of that year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the war, Rogers continued his art career, eventually becoming interested in experimental filmmaking. He eventually produced Toccata Manhatta (1948), Round Trip in Modern Art (1948), Beethoven Fantasy (1949), and Motion Picture III Rhapsody (1950-51). These were referred as &ldquo;Cineplastics&rdquo;, which can only be described as unions of painter and filmmaker, creating a moving painting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRogers died on November 5, 1981 in Bishop, CA, near Los Angeles.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Milton Cooper (changed from Milton Krupka as a child) was born in the Bronx on March 12th, 1913, to Benjamin and Esther Krupka, two Jewish immigrants from Austria who arrived in the states as children in the late 19th century. Cooper grew up with three siblings. He attended New York University from 1931-1933, and he most likely studied writing and journalism as he quickly became a writer and journalist for the Young Communist League (YCL) in 1934, the Communist Party in 1935, as well as the Work Progress Administration (WPA) in 1935. The WPA was part of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#39;s New Deal that employed millions who may not have been educated to build public infrastructure across the United States. Cooper had two addresses listed on his passport in 1936: 461 West 144th Street in Hamilton Heights, and 31 West 16th Street in the Flatiron Neighborhood. At the time, the Flatiron Neighborhood had a multitude of WPA projects such as constructing the 23rd Street Flatiron subway station, repairing Madison Square Park&#39;s Rear Admiral David Glasgow Farragut station, and local art commissions such as Erle Lonsbury&#39;s thousand square foot oil canvases.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCooper decided to join the Republic forces in Spain in 1937. On June 19th, at age 24, Cooper sailed aboard the RMS Berengaria to London. Because it was illegal for U.S. citizens to fight in the Spanish Civil War, Cooper likely posed as a tourist. RMS Berengaria was a commercial liner for Cunard, a company that still specializes in transatlantic trips. From England, Cooper traveled to France, and the only way he could have made it into Spain was the harrowing climb over the steep Pyrenees Mountains that are on France&#39;s border with Spain. The climb was infamously difficult, and needed to be done in one night before sunrise so the border patrol didn&#39;t see one crossing, as the French had closed their border with Spain to prevent volunteers from entering. Cooper made it to Setcases in Spain on July 5th, 1937. He went to Tarazona thereafter and received instruction in the Second Battalion until August 1st. His instruction, like all of those in the Lincoln Brigade, was mainly composed of long communist speeches in French and marching. Cooper would have to learn on the job.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCooper saw battle at the Battle of Belchite (August 24th - September 7th, 1937). The Republic wanted to take Belchite and cities around it as the area, specifically the town of Zaragoza, was the heart of all Fascist communications in the region of Aragon. Serving on the Southern part of the front, Cooper&#39;s battalion quickly took the town of Quinto in four short days. However the final objectives of the Republic were not achieved, as Zaragoza was not taken over, and the Fascist counteroffensive was fierce. Cooper must have been horrified by the bloodbath, quickly learning how to stay alive during the offensive. Falling ill on October 15th, Cooper was hospitalized in Benicasim until November 30th, and was hospitalized in Benissa from December 17th to January 27th, 1938.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCooper rejoined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in May of 1938, and was part of the Ebro Offensive, the largest offensive in the war. The Republican Army was close to being finished after the below-freezing temperatures during the Battle of Teruel in the winter of 1937 to 1938, and the Nationalists Aragon Offensive quickly after. However, the French reopened their Spanish border allowing for the Republic to be resupplied. The resupply raised the Republic morale, and they launched the Ebro offensive July 25th. The Republicans were trying to force the Fascists to lose power over Catalonia and Valencia, allowing for the Republic to regain key infrastructure and territory. Cooper served in the 15th Army Corps, run by Commander Pedro Mateo Merino. Fighting along Poles, Spaniards, Hungarians, and Balkans, Cooper was in a diverse group that didn&#39;t all speak the same language, but by then they had all learned how to fight after the bloody battles they had all been a part of. The Republic initially seemed to be winning, but the offensive turned into a battle of attrition, and the Fascist counteroffensive quickly crushed any Republican hopes. The offensive ended November 16th, 1938, in a terrible loss for the Republic, sealing it&#39;s fate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn December 20th, 1938, after spending almost a year and a half in Spain, Cooper and 50 other Abraham Lincoln Brigade volunteers arrived back in New York City on the RMS Ausonia due to Juan Negr&iacute;n&#39;s de-internationalization of the Republican forces. In his later years, Cooper moved to Orlando, Florida, and passed away on December 9th, 1991.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Rebecca Durem Schulman was born in Dayton, Ohio&mdash;an industrial town considered the &ldquo;birthplace of aviation&rdquo;&mdash; on January 8th, 1911. She was a Russian-American Jew; when she was 4 years old, her mother took her to visit her grandmother in Russia. The visit was unfortunately timed, as the raging revolution occurring in Russia at the time trapped the Schulmans in Russia for four years, during which Schulman&rsquo;s father sent his wife and daughter money to keep them alive. After she and her mother returned from Russia, the Schulman family settled in Brooklyn, New York, on 2168 77th Street (a part of Bensonhurst). Graduating from nursing school in 1931, Schulman served as both a private and a hospital nurse. At Beth Israel hospital in midtown Manhattan, which was founded 40 years earlier to serve Jewish immigrants, Schulman worked with Dr. Edward Barsky, an organizer for medical services in Spain. Dr. Barsky made Schulman aware of Spain&rsquo;s need for medical resources and personnel. Although, in an interview years after the Spanish Civil War, Schulman said she was never &quot;very political,&quot; she believed in Spain&rsquo;s right to a democratically elected government. When Dr. Barksy asked her to work in Spain, a &ldquo;restless, adventurous,&rdquo;travel-eager, twenty-six-year-old Schulman said &ldquo;yes, because they needed nurses and [she wanted] to help right a wrong.&rdquo; While serving at Villa Paz, the American Base&rsquo;s Hospital in Saelices, Schulman met Abraham Lincoln Brigade volunteer Ramon Durem, who was recuperating from a leg wound. Durem was a notable poet; Schulam married him in Aranjuez on March 17th, 1938. After Republican armies were forced to retreat from Villa Paz after an aerial bombing of nearby Urrea de Ga&eacute;n, Schulman was transported to Barcelona by train. On May 11, 1938, she returned to Brooklyn aboard the Normandie due to pregnancy. Reflecting on her experience in the war, Schulman said &quot;I blossomed in Spain. Everyone was your Camarada. We were all together.&rdquo;<br />\r\nSchulman died on August 17, 2002, in Claremont, California at the age of 91. She is survived by three daughters, Dolores&mdash;the daughter she gave birth to after returning from Spain and named after Dolores Ibarruri&mdash;Pilar and Vita, four grandchildren, five great-grandchildren, and one great-great-grandchild.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>George Peters was born in Rhodes, Greece on March 4, 1904. He came to the US at age ten in 1914, a time when immigration policies in the Progressive Era allowed waves of eastern and southern Europeans to settle in America. The Greeks&rsquo; lingering distrust in their government following the economic depression of the late 19th century coupled with the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913 as well as the onset of World War I made immigration to America appealing. Additionally, New York City housed a vibrant hub of well established Greek communities, namely in Astoria, though Peters lived in Chelsea as an adult. He spent his adolescence in New York City and grew up to be a self-employed laborer, possibly in the metalworking industry. He was not part of any unions, but he joined the American Communist Party (CPUSA) in 1935 when Joseph Stalin&rsquo;s new &ldquo;Popular Front&rdquo; agenda sided with FDR and the New Deal, resulting in the CPUSA&rsquo;s most successful years. Rallied by the Communist Party, Peters decided to join the International Brigades in their fight against facism in Spain&mdash;he received his passport on March 2, 1937 and sailed just eight days later aboard the Queen Mary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeters arrived in Spain on March 25, 1937 to serve in the Machine Gun Company (MG Co.) of the Washington Battalion (BN). After limited training, he was transferred to the infantry and sent to fight in the Battle of Jarama, where 66% of American soldiers were either wounded or died. In the days following Jarama, he wrote a letter to the Chief Commander of the International Brigades requesting a transfer back into his old unit, the MG Co., where he had found friendship with Americans and a fellow Greek; his request was most likely granted. In August, he fought in Brunete, where the Republican offensive suffered after a Nationalist counterattack, costing the International Brigades enough soldiers to the point where the battle could be considered a strategic Nationalist victory. Peters was promoted to the rank of Sargento before his next battle in Aragon, where Nationalist forces took Aragon and parts of Catalonia and Levante. The overwhelming death and loss that Peters and his fellow soldiers faced since arriving in Spain was emotionally devastating, and Peters was repatriated in September 1937.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeters returned to Spain by the following year to work in the Albacete Auto Park as well as in artillery in Almasa. He returned to the Washington Battalion in May as a section chief, and fought in the Ebro Offensive, during which he was wounded in action near Corbera in September following a hit by an artillery shell. However, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Spain reported Peters as &ldquo;cowardly&rdquo; for deserting on &ldquo;phony pretexts,&rdquo; ruling him a &ldquo;declassed element&rdquo; on November 1, though this may be an outlier as records from the battalion and Albacete described him as competent and having a &ldquo;high degree of courage&rdquo;. Nonetheless, Peters returned to the United States on December 20, 1938 aboard the Ausonia, and later fought in World War II, drawing from his experiences in Spain to fight the Good Fight once more.</p>\r\n",

They mostly went to the United States and Egypt. This emigration happened because it was encouraged by Greek authorities. They thought this would help improve the balance of the Greek economy by decreasing the amounts of payments by people. This new era was called the &ldquo;New World&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe was a single student during 1933. He received a Spanish Passport which was #367495 on February 16, 1937. He lived at 626 West 136th Street, NYC which is now 202 East 44th Street, NYC. Living near the City College of New York, he was bothered by the noisy activists. He was friends with Wilfred Mendelson, who he called &ldquo;Mendy&rdquo;. Mendy was killed in 1938 during combat as he fought for the leftist Republican government against the fascist Nationalists led by General Francisco Franco. He was also in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade with almost 3,000 volunteers from the U.S. including Mackay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe later moved to 714 Nevada, Urbana, Illinois. Illinois had a great reputation for its American transportation network. Also, general prosperity made it a magnet for immigrants. He then arrived in Spain on March 17, 1937. He served with the XV BDE, Estado Mayor. This brigade reached its peak in spring of 1937. With the highest combat strength, XV BDE did well in serving the Repbulican&rsquo;s first major offense. This was due to a great headquarters element, six infantry battalions, an anti-tank battery, and cavalry squadrons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nUnfortunately, after getting into a fight with his fellow comrades, he got punished. So, he had to serve in Tarazona Service Sanitary as a medical orderly and laboratory worker. He also served at Brunete as Rank Cabo. A rank cabo is a corporal that has the rank between first class private and first corporal. He returned on March 3, 1939 aboard the Manhattan. The Manhattan was a ship from 1902 to 1967.

        "data": "<p>Edna Drabkin Romer was a young, Jewish member of the Socialist party when she enlisted to serve as a nurse in the Spanish Civil War. She and her husband, both self-acclaimed working people, made the journey from New York City to Spain on July 18th, 1937. Upon arrival, her husband immediately headed to the front lines. With credentials and training from the Metropolitan Hospital of New York, Edna worked as a nurse for the American Medical Bureau. She aided the injured and saved lives in the American Hospital, situated in the Palace of Villa Paz in Saelices, Cuenca, as well as with the Auto-Chir on the Aragon Front, the 35th Division on the Teruel Front, and in field hospitals along the Ebro River.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>She described her duties as meaningful, but less than glamorous in letters to her friends in the States. The weather was harsh, often calling for layers of sweaters and sheepskin jackets to ward off the cold. She and her friends used their breaks &ndash; on the rare occasion they could get one &ndash; to search for a water bottle they could heat, but even then they had no fuel to keep a fire. Through it all,&nbsp; even with ten to fifteen hour shifts and constant stress, she found value in the work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The hospital held what she called &ldquo;fiestas,&rdquo; inviting in Spanish peasant farmers, or campesinos, to drink, dance, eat, and listen to political speeches. There were posters for the cause on every wall, games like chess and checkers if they could find the time, and a library with not nearly enough intellectual books to be read.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Romer especially loved the people and the culture. She treated mostly French and Spanish soldiers, who she thought were short-tempered, but always showed mettle. French, Spanish, and the occasional German became required communication skills, and she relished the moments she found to speak English to a fellow nurse or a soldier seeking medical attention.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>When interactions with soldiers and the Medical Bureau&rsquo;s subpar library failed to satisfy her intellectually, she would wait for a visit from someone who could. Ralph Bates, Ernest Hemingway, Martha Gelhorn, Dorothy Parker, and Alan Campbell all visited field hospitals where she served, touring the grounds and offering news about the world outside Spain. Romer even spoke to US Congressmen John Bernard of the Farmer-Labor Party and Jerry Joseph O&rsquo;Connell of the Democratic Party. They gave speeches about FDR&rsquo;s Neutrality Act, calling for it to be overturned as the beginning of an effort to establish a classless society in Spain. Romer thought they were sincere and revolutionary.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In 1937, right in the thick of the war, she wrote a letter home asking for news about the New York elections. The Nationalists had gained most of the Basque region and were pushing Republican forces further towards the Ebro, and Romer wanted to know about Socialist Harry W. Laidler&rsquo;s progress in his run for Governor of New York. She asked whether the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) was still going strong, and whether the Socialist party had gained any traction nationally in the United States. This was her cause.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Her husband, Samuel Romer, served with her, though he was captured by nationalists and spent seven months in a prison camp before being released in exchange for Italian soldiers. After he returned from Spain, he wrote about his experience in a 1938 edition of <em>The Socialist Review</em>, where he described himself and Edna as genuine socialists, whose hearts demanded that they fight in Spain. He said they had no regrets.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Despite the grueling work she performed during the war and her dedication to the Socialist cause, Romer was repatriated to the States fourteen months after arriving. Her superiors thought her insufficiently devoted to the cause of the Popular Front government. They worried she would be vulnerable to enemy subversion because she lacked passion and resolve.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>She returned to the U.S. aboard the Normandie on September 26th, 1938. One of her deepest regrets was not chronicling her time in Spain. After her husband&rsquo;s sudden heart attack in 1965, she held memories of their efforts in Spain close to her heart. Romer passed away at the age of 66 in 1979 and was buried in Florida.</p>\r\n    ",

        "data": "<p>Harry Blum (Kline) was born on December 5th or 6th, 1916 in New York. He attended school through Junior High and became a salesman afterwards. He had two listed addresses: 143 East 16th Street (or 145 East 16th St) in Gramercy Park, and 36 Lewis Street on the Lower East Side, both NYC. With many other young Jewish workers at the time, Blum became a member of the YCL in November 1936 and joined the volunteers to fight for the Republic in Spain a year later, receiving his passport in April 1937. He sailed on May 1, 1937 aboard the Britannic, taking the route from New York to London, and arrived in Spain on the 25th of May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn Spain, Blum fought for the Mackenzie&ndash;Papineau Battalion (Mac-Paps), the Canadian branch of the XV International (Abraham Lincoln) Brigade. Even though the Mac-Paps were nominally Canadian, the battalion was initially made up of more volunteers from the United States than from Canada. He was one of approximately 1,250 Jewish volunteers from the US, which made up 38% of the total. The Jewish volunteers went into Spain to fight for their sense of justice as much as they did for socialism or communism or against fascism. In the 1940s however, the Stalinist opposition to Zionism led to discrimmination against Jewish vertans by the Left and a minimization of their role in the war. As such, much of the information on Jewish volunteers was not maintained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBlum also faced discrimmination, this time for having supported Communism and fighting in the Spanish Civil War, when he and nearly 500 other Abraham Lincoln Brigade veterans enlisted to serve in WWII. With his fellow veterans, Blum wrote against the apparent policy that prohibited those that had volunteered in Spain from receiving promotions or participating in active service. Letters from more than 70 veterans, including some written by Blum and Jack Bjoze, VALB Executive Secretary, document examples of discrimination and discuss means of exposing this policy to the media and putting an end to it. Blum survived WWII and died in March 1974.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Philip Lugiano Sciarra was born on May 22, 1915, in Philadelphia. He was of Italian descent, and it is likely that his parents were part of the four million Italians who immigrated to the U.S between 1880 and 1910. The mass surge of Italian immigrants, known as the Great Arrival, was due to decades of internal strife that had left inhabitants of the country with widespread poverty. More than likely, Sciarra&rsquo;s parents were peasants in the primarily poor, rural south of Italy who had found the call of &ldquo;L`America&#39;&#39; irresistible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSometime before 1937, Sciarra moved from his childhood home (2541 South 10th Street, Philadelphia, PA) to New York, where he settled down in Lower/Midtown Manhattan. The passport he received on January 7, 1937 listed his address as 27 West 15th Street, New York City. The then 23-year old, who had already served four years in the military as a seaman and deck engineer, decided to board the Lafayette &mdash; under the guise of a traveling student, as President Roosevelt&rsquo;s administration had banned visitors to Spain &mdash; on January 9, 1937 to fight in the Spanish Civil War. As a young man living in the capital city of American Communism at the time, it is probable that Sciarra was heavily influenced by the various communist groups that dominated the city&rsquo;s political scene. He was one of the first American contingents to arrive in Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSciarra was enrolled in the XV Brigade, Lincoln, under which he experienced his first taste of combat. He was ranked solado, the lowest ranked insignia of non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel. With only a month and a half of training (much of which consisted of listening to speeches in languages other than his own), Sciarra was thrown into the Battle of Jarama, ill-equipped and unprepared.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn February 26, 1937, Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Copic, the commander of Sciarria&rsquo;s own XVth Brigade, gathered his battalion commanders together to brief them on the plan to take the Nationalist stronghold at Pinigarron. The attack was to commence at 7 A.M with aerial bombardment, followed by strafing of the enemy trenches and an artillery bombardment designed to pin down the enemy. Tanks would lead the frontal assault, providing covering fire for the 24th Spanish Brigade to advance and consolidate with the Lincoln Brigade. Once together, the Spanish were to provide flank support for the Americans who would move forward and capture the enemy trenches.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe plan would go wrong from the very beginning. Bad weather pushed the starting time three hours behind, and miscommunication on the Republican end resulted in a crucial absence of aerial support. Lacking artillery support from tanks in addition to the missing aircrafts, the 24th Brigade took heavy casualties and fell back to their trenches. The Lincoln Brigade, too inexperienced in combat to realize that the battle was lost, clambered out of their trenches and took heavy fire from Nationalist machine guns. Many more, including Sciarra, would have lost their lives had not a rain shower in mid-afternoon clouded the vision of Nationalist snipers. In the midst of battle, Sciarra suffered a leg wound from machine gun fire and was forced to climb back into the trenches under the cover of the rain. He was hospitalized but would return to the field two months later in April. He was wounded and hospitalized again on May 11, 1937. This would be the last time he saw Jarama Valley.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSciarra&rsquo;s time spent at the hospital amidst fighting inspired him to work in the Elche Hospital in June. Once he was deemed physically fit, he was transferred to the Auto Park Brigade, which consisted of dispatchers, drivers, and mechanics. This was likely due to his experience working as an engineer during his earlier military tenure. In June, Sciarra was stationed to participate in the Brunete offensive. To the dismay of him and his fellow comrades, it was learned that the same general who was responsible for the catastrophe in Jarama would be commanding the attack. Despite this feeling of anxiety among the troops, the International Brigades started their advance into enemy territory and were halted in their hastily dug fortifications by hill-top Nationalist fire. The Republican forces suffered big losses, not only from the bullet fire but also the extreme heat and lack of water that had incapacitated many soldiers. The Nationalist counterattack would drive the International Brigades back north towards Brunete, and it was likely here that Sciarra was captured by enemy forces. Sciarra was sent to Albacete, where he was imprisoned in the Guardia Nationale for months. In imprisonment, Sciarra suffered from multiple health ailments and was even diagnosed with dementia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSomehow, under unrecorded conditions, Sciarra found himself back to the front in late February, 1937. On March 7, 1938, General Franciso Franco from the Nationalists&rsquo; side launched a massive attack on the Republican forces gathered in Aragon. The Republican lines swifty collapsed under this assault, and Sciarra was struck down by bullet fire three days into the conflict. He died fighting in Belchite, on March 10, 1938.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Milton &ldquo;Milt&rdquo; Wolff was born on October 8th, 1915, to a Jewish family in Brooklyn. His parents were Yiddish-speaking immigrants from Hungary and Lithuania who made their home in the vicinity of Bay Parkway and Kings Highway. While he lived in Brooklyn, he first resided at 1628 West 5th Street, and later at 74 Quentin Road. He was born into the Great Depression, and he dropped out of the (long-defunct and seemingly obscure) New York School of Commercial Art at age 15 after only a single semester. Wolff then joined the Civilian Conservation Corps, where he was transformed from a shiftless urban teen into a forester. He loved the exercise and the sense of camaraderie between his fellow members, and he was trained in first aid. But eventually, his rosy perspective soured as he witnessed institutional bureaucratism and red tape lead to unsafe working conditions which resulted in the death of one of his friends. He began protesting the CCC&rsquo;s management and conditions, and for this he was expelled. It was during this time that his political consciousness and penchant for organized resistance against oppression began to take shape.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter bouncing around Brooklyn with his friends for a while, he found work at a hat factory in Manhattan&rsquo;s Garment District. Following many colleagues in his social circle, he joined the Young Communists League in April of 1936. Wolff described his political development at the time as &ldquo;rudimentary&rdquo;. Yet by February 20th, 1937, he had set sail for Spain when a YCL organizer asked for volunteers. He told his mother that he was sailing over so he could work in a Spanish factory to free up manpower for the armed workers&rsquo; movement. He secured passage on the Ile de France, and sailed from New York to France. By March 7th, 1937, he had crossed the Pyrenees and reached Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDrawing from his earlier CCC experience, Wolff started out as a medic, and his initial work consisted of carrying water and stretchers. He initially considered himself a pacifist. However, he was soon inspired by the African-American commander of a machine gun unit, and he soon petitioned to serve in a machine gun company. As part of the Washington battalion, he first saw action at Brunete where he narrowly avoided death even while he saw men inches away from him brutally gunned down.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter this engagement, Wolff went on leave in Madrid. During this time, his captain pointed him towards the Cafe Chicote where he first met Ernest Hemingway. Wolff first met Hemingway after seducing his mistress. Hemingway supposedly did not mind this, but he was far more offended when he learned that Wolff had no idea who he was. Initially, Wolff wrote to a friend that Hemingway was &quot;childish in many respects&quot; and that he &quot;want[ed] very much to be a martyr&quot;. He summed up his first thoughts on Hemingway with a quip: &quot;So much for writers. I&#39;d much rather read their works than be with them.&quot; In 1940, when Hemingway published For Whom the Bell Tolls, Wolff later resented his depiction of Republican-sympathizing villagers killing fascists as he thought it overly murderous and bloodthirsty.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter returning from leave, he fought on the Aragon front leading a section of the machine gun company. After performing valiantly despite major losses at Belchite and Quinto, he commanded the machine gun company at Fuentes de Ebro. By January 1938, after not even a single full year in action, he achieved the rank of captain. Wolff drew comparisons to Abraham Lincoln himself, due to his tall and gaunt physique as well as his personal gravitas and strong leadership skills. That March, the base HQ was bombed and the leadership slaughtered. It was at this point that Wolff became the commander. He was preceded by 4 commanders KIA and another 4 seriously wounded. He directed what remained of the battalion through a treacherous retreat from deep behind what had become enemy lines, and traveled alone for six days to the Ebro where he swam across. While rebuilding the battalion as its newly minted commander, he was immortalized in Hemingway&#39;s 1938 Spanish Portraits journalistic series of press vignettes on fighters for the Republican cause. A famous photo of Wolff and Hemingway, taken by photojournalist Robert Capra, was included in the article. A few weeks later, this photograph found its way into the Yiddish newspapers where his mother was alerted to the true nature of his activity in Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the summer of 1938, Wolff led the consolidated Lincoln-Washington battalion back across the Ebro where they held the lines at Hill 666 and held off the fall of Valencia until the Republic ordered the withdrawal of foreign troops later that year. In a ceremonial transfer of authority, Wolff ultimately attained the rank of Major in the Republican Army. By December 15th, 1938, Wolff and the last volunteers made it back to New York City, where Wolff laid a wreath to honor the dead outside Madison Square Park.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter returning to America, Wolff continued a life of service and activism in the name of communism and anti-fascism. Wolff was a beloved figure in Spain, where he returned to visit multiple times. He reminded Spaniards that if they got into trouble in the future, to &ldquo;give me a call&rdquo;. Even after the war&rsquo;s official end, he led street protests in New York City urging the government to lift the Spanish embargo and aid Spanish refugees trapped in neighboring France who were held in what amounted to concentration camps. France threatened to deport the refugees back to Francoist Spain, where they would be treated as enemies of the state and likely tortured or executed. Wolff and other veterans protested outside the French consulate in 1940, and Wolff served 15 days in jail for his activities. He never gave up the fight to free Spain. Wolff was an active member of the U.S. Committee for a Democratic Spain for decades, where he lobbied against political recognition of and treaties with the Franco regime, provided aid to political prisoners and their families, and pushed for democratic reforms. During WWII he was turned down for combat duty due to concerns over his leftist politics, so instead he served with the Office of Strategic Services (which would later become the CIA).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrough a friend of a friend from the war, Wolff came into contact with William Donovan who was selected by President Roosevelt to head the OSS. He assisted Donovan with a project to recruit Spanish Civil War veterans into the British intelligence apparatus. This project began in Spring of 1941 and continued until Pearl Harbor. Then, Wolff directly offered Roosevelt the services of the VALB to the American war effort. This was declined, so Wolff continued recruiting veterans for secret projects in Italy, North Africa, and Normandy. Wolff officially enlisted in 1942, but was quickly marginalized and denied the opportunity to participate in a combat role. He was denied the opportunity to attend Officer Candidate School. In order to try and get a transfer, Wolff then traveled to Burma where he helped the war effort in the Pacific Theater. The OSS then sent him back to Italy where he formed an underground communist partisan network with the help of multiple other Lincoln veterans he had previously embedded. Wolff graduated from parachuting school, which he considered to be one his proudest achievements. He was sent by air into southern France on a top secret mission, but while he was there, he discovered an underground network of Spanish resistance members plotting to invade Spain and overthrow Franco. When Wolff petitioned the OSS to aid them, he was prematurely recalled from his assignment and sent back to America.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrough his stature in the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) he remained a prominent advocate for Spanish Civil War veterans and the causes they espoused. During the Cold War he was the public face of the VALB, where he and Moe Fishman presided over the defense of the Lincoln veterans before the Subversive Activities Control Board in 1954. He and many fellow veterans from New York were lifelong Brooklyn Dodgers fans, and they pushed for integration in the MLB by publicly supporting the inclusion of Jackie Robinson and other black players. He led protests against the Vietnam War and even personally offered Ho Chi Minh VALB military support during their conflict against South Vietnam, which was politely declined. He championed removal of the Cuban embargo, and to this end he helped provide medical aid to a children&rsquo;s hospital in Havana. During the 80s, he and the VALB sent ambulances to the Sandistinas as the Reagan government was funding the anticommunist insurgency.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilton Wolff passed away on January 14th, 2008 at the age of 92 due to congestive heart failure. He is survived by his two children, Susan and Peter, from his first marriage with Anne Gondos. Additionally, he has at least four grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Herman (or Hy, as he was called by his friends, which was short for Hyman) Hollander was born on the 14th of May, 1914 in the city of Lemberg (modern day Lw&oacute;w), Poland. While he was ethnically Polish, the brief years that he spent in that city did not define him. Even during the sunset of his life&mdash;spent in Sunrise, Florida&mdash;he identified as a proud and true New Yorker, specifically from his beloved Lower East Side. It was in this neighborhood that he began his political journey, met his lifelong friends and comrades, and found the fire and determination to be a fighter for his beliefs regardless of age.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hy&#39;s early childhood was marked by an intrusive and disruptive disparity between the different spheres of his life. During his time in Poland, he can remember his grandmother telling him that, &quot;the revolutionaries are in town,&quot; in reference to the Bolsheviks. These loaded words, and the bodies hanging from the gallows that accompanied them flew over Hy&#39;s 6 year old head, but left him asking questions. These sights of tragedy followed Hy and his father even after their move to the States in 1920 after the death of Hy&#39;s mother. They were driven by this tragedy, the prevalent discrminiation towards Jews in Poland, and the promise of a better life. While Hy and his father did move into an ethnically diverse Williamsburg that accepted them, they could not escape poverty&#39;s grasp. One of the defining images from Hy&#39;s childhood that would go on to influence him for the rest of his life was of people in his neighborhood scrounging through barrels and garbage pails for food during the early 30s. Before those teenage years, Hy had always asked why things like war and hunger had to exist, but after his maturation, he was suddenly driven by the horrific images of his past to act. To help. To do his part.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hy was an excellent student, but often found the schoolroom itself lacking for mental stimulation. This would lead him to the Brooklyn Public Library, where he would spend hours reading about his passions&mdash;history and geography&mdash;and the world&#39;s great revolutions. After his visits to the library, he would hear a monthly speaker that would appear on the corner of Varet Street and Graham Avenue near his neighborhood. This man discussed Soviet Russia and its tenets: peace, bread, employment, and equality. Through this speaker, Hy joined the Youth Branch of the Downtown Workers&#39; Club, which finally led him to the Youth Communist League, or YCL. Herman eventually rose to become the President of the Youth Section, and provided food and shelter to the homeless and disadvantaged youths, regardless of the police&#39;s frequent attempts to disrupt him and his friends. He participated in demonstrations for unemployment insurance and for food aid. This ragtag group of YCL boys were beaten by the police, but none of them cared. For them, the League wasn&#39;t as much about a political ideology as it was about helping people, and doing the right thing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was out of this burning conviction that Herman found the need to go to Spain. He hated what Hitler was saying, and was also able to sympathize with the victims of Pogroms and Concentration Camps. He feared that if Hitler wasn&#39;t stopped in Europe, &quot;then instead of Normandy, there would be fighting in Coney Island and Brighton Beach.&quot; Hy felt that he was bound to his duty because he was a member of the human race, and because he believed in a government without oppression that was controlled by the people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After an 11-day voyage aboard the German ocean-liner <em>Berengaria</em>, during which he had his 23rd birthday, Hy disembarked at the Hague and made his way to Paris. After a series of train rides and nighttime walks through villages, he crossed the Pyreenees. After their descent, and arrival in Spain, he and his troupe were greeted by the locals with hospitality and&mdash;more importantly&mdash;wine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hy&#39;s tour in Spain lasted for 14 months, during which he served in the Jarama Valley, Bruneti, Teruel, Albacete, and others. He said himself that being in battle felt like, &quot;the world was coming to an end.&quot; The noise was beyond anything that he had ever experienced, and the sight of what he called the &quot;Lower East Side Boys&quot; being felled beside him was often too much to bear. Two major anecdotes stand out when it comes to his time on the battlefield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first reflects the closeness of the Lincolns, both on the field and off. A man named Jack Weiss, who was Herman&#39;s cousin, served with Herman during the Bruneti campaign. He was injured in the field and was being dragged back behind the lines on a litter, bleeding profusely. He happened to pass by Herman, and when he saw him, Jack shook his fist at Hy as best he could and said, &quot;if you tell my sister that I was wounded then I&#39;ll get even with you.&quot; Herman responded by calling the man crazy, and told him to get some rest while chuckling. Jack fortunately made a recovery from his injury, albeit with a bad leg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second was tragically all too commonplace. A friend of Hy&#39;s, named Sauly Bernbaum, was a Captain in the John Brown Battery. Sauly was greatly admired by Hy, particularly his sense of duty and responsibility as a leader, and the extent to which he acted on these convictions. Sauly never ran away, and never put himself first. The two men served together during the Belchite campaign, which was characterized by the vicious covering fire of Nationalist snipers to slow the Lincolns&#39; advance. During one such push, the group had to run through open ground, and one of their comrades was shot. He was still alive, but could no longer run with the company. Sauly, out of a sense of compassion or duty or both, turned and tried to help the fallen man. In vain he pulled at the near-deadweight, hoping against hope that this man, his friend, would not be left in no-man&#39;s land under withering fire. His fellows, Hy among them, looked on in pain for a moment, before one broke the silence and simply said, &quot;you have to go on.&quot; This is a phrase that Herman would never forget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would stay burned in his mind for years to come, and after once again serving the US in the Second World War as a member of Signal Radio Intelligence, it would shape his career choices. Herman became a leader in movements for various unions in New York City, chief among them being a union for Taxi drivers, which began in 1949. He worked with notables such as Harry Van Arsdale, and got Lincoln Veterans jobs by collaborating with Moe Fishman, the General Secretary of the Brigade&#39;s Veterans&#39; Association. After moving to Florida because of his wife&#39;s health, he joined the National Council of Senior Citizens, and continued to do good work for the community into his own seniority.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Herman Hollander lived an amazing, full life. He rose out of a poor, first-generation immigrant family of Polish Jews to become somebody who made a great difference. He didn&#39;t die a wealthy or famous man, but Herman possessed something that few do. He was proud of his life&#39;s work, and had truly done his part. When asked what he thought about the Spanish Civil War and its effect on his life, he said, &quot;There&#39;s no doubt about it in my mind, and in my heart, what I did 50 years ago is the most beautiful thing that any human being could do. It was a just cause, it was the right thing to do.&quot; He put his life on the line for what he believed in, and helped a cause that would, finally in 1975, bear fruit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Herman was able to see a democratic Spain, and made a trip there in 1986. Amidst all the talks he attended and the gifts he was given, one moment stood out to him as perhaps the best moment of his life. One day during the trip, he and some other veterans saw a protest of mostly young Spanish people moving past the outside of their hotel. The elderly men raised their arms in the Republican Salute, and to their surprise and satisfaction (in Herman&#39;s words) &quot;got it right back.&quot;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>John Gates was born in 1913. A New York City native, he was Jewish with Polish ancestry.&nbsp; He had a brother and three sisters. Throughout his childhood, his father owned and operated small businesses. After graduating from DeWitt Clinton high school, Gates attended City College where his life changed forever after he came across Marx&rsquo;s writing.&nbsp; That discovery led to Gates dropping out of college at age 17 and joining the Communist Party. Then he eventually became a community organizer for unemployed Ohio youth and ran for Youngstown City Council.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When running for the Youngstown City Council, Gates was jailed for causing public disturbances. This was one of the several in his life he was arrested. He was later jailed in New Castle Pennsylvania in 1935 for distributing pamphlets. This was a difficult time for Gates; while being arrested for fighting for what he believed in, the Great Depression made it almost impossible to find a job and forced him to resort to living on public assistance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In early 1937 Gates joined the International Brigade for Spanish Civil War, like many involved in the Communist Party. As a soldier under the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, he was a commisar at age 24, the highest ranking American in the Spanish Civil War. He was an extremely strict battalion commissar. Gates even executed some of his comrades on grounds of desertion. This earned him the hatred and anger of his subordinates. However, he showcased his stamina and bravery by fighting in nearly every single battle throughout the war.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the war, Gates became a secretary for the organization &ldquo;Friends of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade&rdquo; and director of the Young Communist League in New York State. He would eventually become the editor in chief of the communist newspaper, <em>The Daily Worker</em>. It was quite clear that his high position in the Spanish Civil War jump started the rest of his career. That may be why he put his newfound marriage to a woman named Lillian aside to enlist in World War II. After initially being kicked out for being a communist, Gates successfully volunteered as a paratrooper. This was an arduous job for a man in his thirties. Once again he took on a position of authority, this time informal, as a mentor for the much younger paratroopers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite being a veteran, Gates was betrayed by his country. In an incident that gained him infamy, he and ten other comrades were accused of plotting to overthrow the government. Although this claim was denied by all the defendants, it was clear that their Communist ties had made the court view them as enemies of the state during the red scare. Gates was convicted on October 14th, 1949 to a five year jail sentence, characteristic of the McCarthy era.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During this jail time, Gates started questioning much of his philosophies, including Communism. Although posthumously he is known for being one of the most prominent and high ranking members of the Communist Party, Gates actually stopped getting involved in the party in the mid 1900s. Much like POUM, Gates didn&rsquo;t support Stalin, and the Communist Party&rsquo;s increasing alignment with the Soviet Union made him leave. He officially left his communist party position on January 1st, 1958. This was the subject of his book, <em>The Story of an American Communist</em>, a personal memoir published in 1959. Gates&rsquo;s falling out with the American Communist Party had led to the closure of his Communist party controlled newspaper, <em>The Daily Worker</em>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, even after leaving the party Gates still held onto many of his prior beliefs, like the pro-worker stance. This motivated his joining of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union as the senior research assistant, where he helped the workers gain Social Security, unemployment, and compensation. Gates continued his job at the International Ladies Garment Workers Union after serving in World War II, until eventually retiring in 1987. Gates spent his retirement out of the public eye, presumably with his family before dying of heart disease and stroke, in Miami Beach, Florida on May 23rd, 1992 .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At his core, it is evident that John Gates truly cared about social justice. Some of his key values were transitioning to socialism, and loyalty to America. He was survived by his wife, Lillian Gates.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Born in 1904, Alvah Cecil Bessie was the second son of Adeline Schlesinger and Daniel Nathan Cohen Bessie, a successful New York City businessman. He was raised in Harlem and grew up attending public school, ultimately matriculating from DeWitt Clinton High School (then an all- boys school located on Tenth Avenue between 58th Street and 59th Street in Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen) in 1920 to Columbia College, where he earned his degree in English in 1924. After his older brother died and left the Bessie family with significant financial baggage, the younger Bessie was for the first time free of his commanding father&rsquo;s clutches and free to pursue what he wanted. After a four-year stint trying his hand at acting in the New York theater scene and subsequently recognizing his limited capabilities, Bessie decided to pursue writing. In 1928 he took a yearlong trip to France and translated avant-garde French literature while writing, and eventually publishing, his first short story &ldquo;Redbird.&rdquo; He returned to the United States in 1929, and over the following six years was married, moved to Vermont, and had two sons. During this time, as he published numerous stories, essays, and reviews for various magazines and newspapers, Bessie was also writing his first novel Dwell in the Wilderness (1935), which won him a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1935. This was also when he began studying Marxist theory, which, when coupled with his move back to the city in 1935, led to his joining the Communist Party in 1936.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once back in New York (and living at a new residence: 164 Lexington Avenue in Kips Bay, according to his 1937 passport), Bessie was hired by the Brooklyn Daily Eagle as an editor for their drama and book sections. His time there was ripe with disagreement, as his radical stance on several issues (most notably the Spanish Civil War) did not mesh with his superiors&rsquo; conservative views. The final straw, Bessie&rsquo;s support of French novelist, aviator, and activist Andre Malraux&rsquo;s efforts to organize and send a group of French flyers to help the Spanish Republic, led to his resignation from this post in 1937. Shortly thereafter, he found a new position working for the Spanish Information Bureau, a New York propaganda agency of the Spanish Republican government whose purpose was to distribute promotional materials that contained information directly from Spain in order to spread word about what was occurring abroad. During this turbulent period, Bessie&rsquo;s marriage also began to dissipate, and he was shortly thereafter divorced from his wife.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After working for the Spanish Information Bureau all summer and consulting his ex-wife (who told him, &ldquo;If you have to do it, do it&rdquo;), Bessie decided, &ldquo;Hell, I want to go there!&rdquo; and sailed to Spain to join the International Brigade in January of 1938. Much like many of the other Brigade volunteers, Bessie saw the effort not only as a struggle for Spain, but also as a larger fight against fascism and what he deemed the &ldquo;eternal enemy&mdash;oppression.&rdquo; Indeed, years after the war he would say, &ldquo;when I enlisted in the International Brigade of the Spanish Republican Army, I was convinced that I was helping to preserve my country from international fascism.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Bessie had earned his pilot&rsquo;s license before sailing over with the intention to become a flyer, he was put on the front lines with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. He, along with the other new arrivals, quickly discovered that the war effort was not nearly as glamorous as they had envisioned. As he moved with the Brigade towards the Ebro River, Bessie wrote of a lack of adequate supplies (whether it be equipment, medical kits, or food), a near-complete lack of discipline, and seeds of self-doubt, wondering in his diary, &ldquo;Will I be a coward?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bessie soon arrived at his answer when the Lincoln Brigade accidentally stumbled upon a Nationalist camp and had to flee for their lives. For several days, he and three companions straggled towards the Ebro River, whose far bank promised refuge and comrades. However, once there he found similarly destitute conditions amid streets &ldquo;jammed with ragged and demoralized men, wandering idly about.&rdquo; When word came of Nationalist tanks on the way, Bessie and the scraggly band of volunteers made their way to a town further eastward, which they found had at least some semblance of order. Here, they received copies of the International Brigades&rsquo; publication, The Volunteer for Liberty, for which Bessie was a correspondent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Franco&rsquo;s troops advanced towards the Mediterranean Sea, Bessie and the rest of the Brigade knew their cause was becoming more hopeless by the day unless foreign nations provided much- needed aid. Alas, they did not, and by the summer of 1938, Franco&rsquo;s forces controlled most of Spain, with the notable exceptions of Madrid, Barcelona, and Valencia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dire circumstances and dearth of supplies forced the Republic to desperate measures. Commanders began preparing Bessie and the rest of the International Brigade to cross the Ebro River, whose journey promised difficulty enough, but whose destination promised both sure hostility from the Nationalist troops housed there and the foreboding certainty that survival depended solely on capturing enemy supplies (after crossing the Ebro, Bessie wrote in his diary of the lack of food and his and his comrades&rsquo; sleeping &ldquo;in straw, in stone barn[s]; dead tired, hungry, wet with perspiration&rdquo;). This, coupled with the vastly superior arms and numbers of the Nationalist force, made for a grim outlook for Bessie and the rest of the 80,000 troops carrying out the offensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unexpectedly, the slightly inexperienced Nationalist troops on the other side were taken by surprise and shock when the Republic&rsquo;s troops first made their move. But soon after the initial Republican victory, the Nationalists struck back so furiously that Bessie wrote of a full week without taking off his boots, even when resting. The back and forth dragged on and continued through the sweltering summer heat of August, which Bessie described as having drenched the men &ldquo;from head to foot with sweat.&rdquo; The rocky terrain did them no favors either, making digging trenches (and much-needed graves) an impossible endeavor. Food was both scarce and bad (Bessie particularly recalled &ldquo;a petrified sort of blood-sausage that was more gristle than meat&rdquo;), and diarrhea was rampant in the camp. But through it all, Bessie found both time and energy to put into writing his thoughts and experiences, writing one afternoon as he sat awaiting the call to action, &ldquo;At such times the tension is intolerable&hellip; Your stomach clenches and unclenches&hellip; and there is a deep ache in your chest. You look around and you see other men sitting, talking calmly, showing no fear in their faces, acting as though they were on a picnic in the woods&hellip; For men do not like to show fear in the presence of other men, and they put on a good act.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bessie noted that he would act just as coolly as the other men, but knew inside as he watched more and more drafted, spiritless, and unfit Spanish reinforcements arrive that the Republic was becoming increasingly more desperate in its likewise increasingly futile efforts. The Americans remained steadfastly loyal to their cause, but Spanish men began deserting. Even when the Republican side received a rare piece of good news in the form of new anti-aircraft guns, they did almost nothing against the vastly superior Nationalist aircraft, a fact which Bessie described as &ldquo;heart-breaking&rdquo; and only added to his waning confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rare breaks in the constant fighting brought even worse horrors than the chaos it replaced; Bessie recalled trying to &ldquo;[rise] from the narrow niche in which you had been lying in all day[;] it was almost impossible&hellip; you had to look at [your legs] to assure yourself that they were still there, and will them to move.&rdquo; The misfortunes piled on: Bessie&rsquo;s best friend was shot in the eye and shortly thereafter died, a Nationalist shell finding its mark that was a Republican food truck resulted in no food for the night, and, perhaps worst of all, word reached the men of France and Britain&rsquo;s eagerness to placate the increasingly hostile Hitler, which meant that any previous shred of hope for aid from the Western democracies had now all but disappeared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also taking notice of these happenings was Stalin, who was growing continuously convinced that Hitler would be quite a formidable enemy, and one that would need to be faced without the help of France and Britain. Stalin began diverting attention away from Spain, withdrawing Soviet officers and ceasing the shipment of arms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spain&rsquo;s government took note of this and, clinging onto desperate hopes of pressuring Franco into similarly withdrawing his foreign troops, declared in front of the League of Nations that all International Brigaders would be withdrawn from and pushed out of Spain. Bessie knew the Spanish government&rsquo;s gamble was one of low stakes, for of the mere few thousand worn-out Brigaders left, most lay in hospital beds rather than on the frontlines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so, Bessie and the rest of the Americans&rsquo; time in Spain ended in October of 1938, with their efforts culminating in a celebratory march down one of Barcelona&rsquo;s most splendid streets for an official farewell. In their mismatched footwear and run-down attire, the men cried and marched to the tune of raucous cheering from Spanish civilians mingled with the sounds of the Republican planes flying overhead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though his time in Spain had come to an end, Bessie&rsquo;s impact was far from over. Upon his return to the States, his Spanish Civil War journals became the basis of his famous wartime memoir, Men in Battle (1939), which Ernest Hemingway would commend as a &ldquo;true, honest, [and] fine book. Bessie writes truly and finely of all that he could see&hellip; and he saw enough.&rdquo; Bessie would go on to become a celebrated novelist and screenwriter, the latter of which would lead him to a prominent role in the 1940s as one of the blacklisted Hollywood Ten that resisted anti-communist investigations into the film industry by the House of Representatives. Even when not fighting for Spain in uniform, Bessie remained unwaveringly loyal to his Communist and anti-fascist beliefs, continuing the greater fight and purpose of the Spanish Civil War.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Mike (also known as Moses or Morris) Bailin was born in Chicago, Illinois on June 4, 1916 to parents Israel B. Bailin and Clara Olinero, both members of the Communist Party. Israel Bailin was a Jewish communist, and he wrote for a communist affiliated Yiddish newspaper called the Morning Freiheit as well as multiple books. Bailin was influenced and radicalized by his father, citing him as the place he gained interest in the proletariat movement. Also because of his father, he grew up and was nurtured in the socialist Yiddish shulns, further pushing him towards the left. Sometime within the first few years of his life, he ended up in New York City, where he attended the City College of New York. While there, he studied chemical engineering and also learned Spanish, the knowledge of the former used later in work for the US army after World War II. He hit working age just as the Great Depression hit, affecting his job prospects. In the years between 1930 and 1937, he worked as a clerk in the Works Progress Administration making $16 a week, was an electrician/air conditioning technician, was a laundry worker, and was part of the National Guard. He was part of unions for most of these jobs, including the Laundry Workers International Union, the City Projects Council, and the Brooklyn Federation of WPA Timekeepers, the latter of which he joined in a several weeks long strike. Bailin was in the National Guard as part of the 212th Coast Artillery Regiment from October 1936 to when he left in 1937 for Spain, which is most likely why he eventually joined an artillery battery. He was also a member of the Young Communist League, the aim of which is to develop its members into educated communists, serving as the youth wing of the American Communist Party. He held the position of Section Education Director in the organization. Bailin actively went to demonstrations against fascism and racial discrimination, and presumably because of his protesting, he was arrested twice for disorderly conduct in July of both 1934 and 1935, serving a 2 day jail sentence in 1934. He presumably applied for a passport to go to Spain and received the number on June 7th, 1937, with an address on it located in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. There are two dates he may have sailed for Spain, as two different days are listed in different sources: May 17th 1937 or June 16th 1937.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe mentions traveling through France to get to Spain, so he most likely made the harrowing trek through the Pyrenees. Upon arrival, he was sent to the training base for the International Artillery, Almansa. He joined one of the Anglo-American Heavy Artillery Batteries formed in 1937, the 14th Battery, 2nd Group, 11th Regiment, better known as the John Brown Battery. The men trained at this base frequently had the complaint that the leadership was very poorly organized and &ldquo;near criminally ineffective.&rdquo; The base commander, Major Paul Maurice, was a Frenchman and gave heavy preferential treatment to any others of his nationality, such as giving them free passes to town while the rest of the men were restricted to the barracks. The commander was not inclined to let Americans touch the antiquated guns that the base had (an English 80mm and a French Schneider 75mm), so the training was limited to &ldquo;close-order drill; instruction on military courtesy; and lecture on theoretical and strategic use of artillery.&rdquo; One incident where the commander enforced the barracks restriction while Almansa was under air attack led to his eventual arrest and removal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe John Brown Battery&rsquo;s initial training with the 2 antiquated guns was under the French Battery commander Lieutenant Maurice Tavlitsky. He received proper artillery training in the Soviet Union, and in order to avoid being restricted by Base Commander Maurice, Tavlitsky faked his reports and let the Americans get hands-on training, despite the Commander&rsquo;s reluctance. Shortly before they were going to get sent to the front, they received two guns as a result of Soviet Aid. They were French 155mm guns, stamped with production dates of 1880 and 1893. Not quite satisfied with the quality of the equipment, they nicknamed the guns &ldquo;Tuchachefsky&rsquo;s Last Shipment.&rdquo; These guns arrived without any of the firing tables or instrumentation needed to fire them, which was even further complicated by the fact that these guns had been constructed before the invention of recoil management technology. The regiment&rsquo;s deployment was moved and it trained for a few months longer in order to create a firing table as well as practice how to fire the guns while dealing with recoil. They finally deployed in October of 1937, with all the men receiving at least 5 months of training, far more than most.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe night before leaving for the front, the Battery had 70 men, majority of whom were American, and occupying a variety of jobs. Bailin was a sentry, doing observation and reconnaissance. He reports being part of the Socorro Rojo Internacional (SRI) while in Spain, which set up vital infrastructure like hospitals and soup kitchens in Republican territory. The people Bailin was closest to while in Spain were Sam Berman and Jack Waters, both members of the John Brown Battery. He also mentions a David King, but there are no men under that name listed as part of the Brigades. From deployment until December, the Battery was in Villanueva de la Serena as part of the Extremaduran campaign. At the onset of the war, the Foreign legion marched up from Seville and took the capital of Extremadura as well as everywhere but the East. Villanueva de la Serena is a small village along the front, due East from M&eacute;rida. It is unknown how much action the regiment was involved in while stationed there, but theoretically not very much as the nationalists had moved on to Toledo and Madrid by that point. After about 3 months, the Battery was then moved to the Toledo front until the formal repatriation of the International Brigades in September of 1938. Their mission in Toledo was to provide support to infantry on the front lines outside the city, but the front was quiet and the Battery rarely saw combat. Bailin was on the front for about a year, and was never in active fighting and was never injured. When asked about his opinion on the proceedings of the International Brigades, he wrote this: &ldquo;I think it served a great role. It not only helped save Madrid, but during Spain&rsquo;s darkest hour it brough living proof that they were not forgotten&ndash;not alone in their fight-that they had support from every corner of the Earth. It had many faults in its organization but on the whole its political lore was correct. The organizational faults consisted of big administrative staffs and their bureaucratic methods which made the common soldier feel he was not getting enough consideration.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBailin left with the rest of his regiment on February 4th 1939, sailing home on the President Harding with most of the others from his Battery. Soon after his return, World War II hit, during which he was not part of the army. After the war, he worked as a chemical engineer for the US Army Signal Corps and Navy. He was part of research and development projects for insulating materials. There is no information on his life from there until his death in Brooklyn on June 26, 1997.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Fanny Golub was born on April 18th, 1904 into a Jewish family. Not much is known about her childhood, except that she had a strong passion for helping others. Therefore, it was no surprise when she pursued medicine and graduated in 1926 as &ldquo;Fannie&rdquo; Golub, from the Hunter-Bellevue School of Nursing on East 26th Street in Kips Bay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause she was so dedicated to her work, she went as far as to find a home across the street from Bellevue Hospital. She resided at 142 East 27th Street in Kips Bay throughout the following decade in order to keep her commute short. Whilst she was working at the hospital through the Great Depression, Golub found people who shared her ideology at a local communist organization. Though she was never a certified member of the Communist party, she had strong ties with the Leftist movement and was able to form lifelong connections. Between attending party meetings and working as a nurse, she moved to 142 East 18th Street in Gramercy Park by 1937 which, although further from her workplace, was larger in size. Unfortunately, most records of her affiliation to the communist organization were lost during the McCarthy era.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1936, news was spreading of a Nationalist rebellion led by Spanish Generals. This rebellion rose to overthrow the established Popular Front Republic in Spain. President Roosevelt&rsquo;s administration was critical of any American involvement in this civil war. As the war progressed, Golub grew increasingly concerned that fascism was beginning to take hold as Adolf Hitler offered assistance to the Spanish coup d&rsquo;etat leaders. Golub decided something needed to be done to stop the advance of fascism around the world. On March 24th, 1937 she received passport #378165 and, only a month later, she departed for Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGolub served under Dr. Barksky&rsquo;s team on the battlefront alongside other U.S. nurses, including Salaria Kea, Helen Freeman, Grace Margolis etc. During her time in Spain, it became the norm to work under pressure and with limited resources, including a lack of sterile tools. Many tragedies unfolded around Golub, including bombings, and she grew accustomed to the war-torn environment. On the 15th of April 1938, she was working directly on the Aragon front and witnessed the death of many Abraham Lincoln Brigade volunteers while tending to the wounded. After this unfortunate event, her team retreated to living and working out of a Jesuit college until June of that year. During her stay, she sometimes had to share her clothing and a cot with her fellow volunteers. Despite the many hardships faced during this war, the nurses grew to be very close friends and recalled Golub fondly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGolub left Spain on August 13th, 1938. Unable to travel directly from Spain to the U.S. due to President Roosevelts&rsquo; restrictions, Golub crossed the border to France and spent three to five days in Paris before sailing on the RMS Aquitania to the U.S. Still, Golub&rsquo;s days of fighting fascism were not yet over. In further allegiance against fascism, she served again as a nurse during World War II. Despite many years of service, Golub was discriminated against, possibly due to her gender and religion. She had to file a discrimination complaint, and yet was still determined to continue her service towards helping others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe passed away in Kings County, Brooklyn and was buried by the Jewish Center of Hyde Park. Though she never married or had children in her lifetime, her headstone reads &ldquo;Freedom Fighter&rdquo; and &ldquo;Loving Daughter, Sister, and Aunt&rdquo;.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Gabriel Jack Quinones was born on April 30th, 1910, in the Bronx borough of New York City. His highest form of education was his second year of college, and his occupation was being a driver before he went to Spain. Quinones was a part of the Young Communists League USA (1922-1946), where their messages of democracy and socialism resonated with him at a young age. Learning of the injustices in Spain happening against his Communist comrades, he was emboldened to fight on the warfront.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQuinones obtained his passport on February 17, 1937, and he boarded the Ile de France just three days after. He arrived in Spain on March 15th. As a soldier under the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, he was given the name Jack Gabriel in an attempt to &quot;Americanize&quot; him, although he was already white. Using his experience, he worked under the Regiment de Tren as a driver before being transferred to the American Hospital at Tarancon, on September 5th, 1937, a bit over a month after he fought at the Battle of Brunete.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Battle of Brunete was an attack launched by General Vicente Rojo of the Republicans in order to exploit a weakness in the Nationalist lines and ease the pressure of an ongoing offensive in Santander, located near the northern region of Spain. This attack was well equipped, with 50,000 men, 128 tanks, and 150 aircraft. The Republicans succeeded in the capture of Brunete and a small, nearby village named Villanueva de la Canada. However, the small village was not a significant military asset, and the Republican forces were not able to make significant progress to their destination of the Romanillos heights. Due to constant aerial bombardment and fatigue, Brunete was quickly taken back by Nationalist forces, barely a week later. Quinones had survived this battle and was part of the retreating army.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvidently, not deterred by the loss in Brunete, Quinones would go on to employ his skillset in the Battle of Aragon, working as a driver for the #1 American Medical Bureau to Save Spanish Democracy (AMB). He was a valuable asset, being both a driver and a handyman, meaning that he would be able to quickly fix any mechanical issues that plagued the Republicans, not just cars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Battle of Aragon lasted from March 7, 1938, to April 19 of the same year. It began as an offensive launched by the Nationalist army, and it had caught the Republican forces completely off guard. There was no question as to who the victor would be; Franco&rsquo;s forces enjoyed the advantage of having better gear, larger numbers, and the element of surprise. Many Republican troops saw the battle as futile and abandoned their posts. Those loyal stood their ground, and yet their bravery was paid in kind with lead. Quinones was one of the latter, a noble man who stayed to ferry the injured to hospital tents. This courageous act would spell his retirement from the war; on March 14 --barely a week after the battle began&ndash; Quinones was wounded in a bombing of the hospital tent he was working in. He was out of commission, and returned to the U.S. on July 20. Quinones stayed long enough to see the battle&rsquo;s conclusion: a crushing defeat for the Republicans, and the spiral of losses they would yet face.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQuinones arrived home aboard the Champlain, and married Dorothy Rose Baskin on February 8, 1939, only a few months before the war had officially ended. Baskin was a job interviewer for the state of New York, and Quinones took up a profession of photography. It seemed that Baskin was the primary breadwinner of the house, as she earned more income between the two, while Quinones (most likely plagued from war and his wound) was a freelancer. He lived out the rest of his life in relative peace, without any other sort of notable contributions in the public eye. Quinones moved to Long Beach, California, where he died peacefully on October 14, 1992. Baskin joined her husband in 1997.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>On April 9, 1998, Frederick Salvini was born to Domenico Salvini and Diomira (Litterini) Salvini in the town of Vela Banale in Northeastern Italy. Salvini was one of the over four million Italians who immigrated to America between 1880 and 1924. Although the exact date and reason of his immigration are unknown, we can assume he came in this period in order to flee poverty and overpopulation as in the 1870s the birth rates in Italy rose and the death rates dropped. Before reaching his final destination of New York City, Salvini moved to Switzerland, Germany, and France.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAs an Italian immigrant in New York City, Salvini most likely lived in tenements surrounded by other Italian Americans. Most of these new immigrants were illiterate laborers who didn&rsquo;t know english. The men typically worked blue-collar jobs as construction workers and the women worked in the garment industry. They were exploited for their labor because of their little knowledge of English and New York and their desperation to make a living. Italian Americans responded to this by beginning efforts to unionize and Salvini was heavily involved in this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSalvini was a worker and was part of the West Side Communist section of the International Workers Order (IWO). The International Workers Order was founded to bring benefits to immigrants at a low cost, like health insurance, life insurance, and burial insurance. Along with insurance benefits, the IWO brought along social benefits by breaking off into ethnic groups (mainly Jewish) and organizing activities, supporting Newspapers in different languages, and more. Although the IWO wasn&rsquo;t officially a Communist group, many of their actions and ideals were aligned with the party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe West Side Communist part of the IWO that Salvini was in included Mennella, Mellina, Paolo Sarti, Domenico Medelin and Salvatore Menis. These men are largely unknown, but they all have one thing in common with Salvini, they all became a part of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade from New York City. Salvini and these other New Yorkers who sacrificed themselves to go fight in Spain held a similar ideology of socialism or at least were extremely anti fascist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSalvini, a new immigrant to the United States, returned to Europe to fight because he believed so strongly in the cause. Additionally, the Spanish Civil War was the main outlet to fight Facism because it had already succeeded in Italy and Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOn January 20th, 1937 Salvini sailed to Spain to join the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. He then reunited with his Italian roots and joined the Garibaldi Brigade which was mostly Italian volunteers. He was in the third Battalion of the Brigade and quickly rose in the ranks from a soldier (soldado), to a sergeant (sargento), to a lieutenant (teniente). He fought in all the battles that the Garibaldi Brigade engaged in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAlthough he was an extremely active soldier, we know most about Salvini&rsquo;s participation in the Battle of the Ebro. This was an offensive battle initiated by the Republican forces in an effort to stop Franco&rsquo;s troops from reaching Valencia. Ebro ended up being a huge victory for Franco and an extremely important battle in the war, even though much about it is still largely unknown. The battle consisted of three months of intense trench warfare combined with other strategic uses of technology such as tanks, trucks, bridges, and boats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOn October 13, 1938, towards the end of the Battle of the Ebro, Salvini was taken prisoner by Franco&rsquo;s nationalists and turned over to Italian Fascists in Spain. He was then deported back to Italy as a prisoner of war. His fate remains unknown, some sources tell us he was interrogated and executed, but others inform us he made it back to America alive. Either way, Salvini&rsquo;s sacrifice and efforts were crucial in building international support during the Spanish Civil War.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Steve Nelson was born as Stjepan Mesaros in a small farming village of Subocka, Croatia on January 1, 1903. He was ethnically Hungarian. Needing to work for his family&rsquo;s mill at age eight&mdash;he only received five years of formal education. After WW1, he emigrated to an ethnically diverse, working-class neighborhood in Philadelphia with his extended family. In America, he adopted the Anglicized form of his name. They were part of the second wave of American immigration: where the majority of immigrants came from Southern and Eastern Europe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNelson worked a variety of factory jobs: ranging from slaughterhouses and meat-packing plants to auto plants and metal works. Eventually he picked up carpentry, a trade which would sustain him throughout his life. His co-workers introduced him to socialist ideology and writings. From there, he researched more about the Communist Party and was inspired by their efforts to improve working conditions for blue-collar workers. Nelson joined the Young Communist League in 1923, and the Communist party in 1925, where he was a zealous member. He was a union organizer who distributed communist newspapers, even visiting anthracite mines to recruit fellow Croatian workers into the party. For Croatian-Americans, communism did not only involve studying party doctrine. It was more of a thriving community: full of picnics, dances, cruises, and plays. It gave them hope and a solution to the problems they faced.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen he moved to Pittsburgh in search of work, he met Margaret Yaeger in the office of the local Communist Party. Yeager shared a similar political passion to Nelson&rsquo;s and the two became very close, the language barrier. Encouraged by Yeager, Nelson developed his English skills and the two got married in 1925 after they moved to Detroit. After working in the automotive industry, the two moved to New York three years later. Nelson took lessons at the New York Workers&rsquo; School, where he studied Marxist theory and history. This school was an ideological training center founded by the Communist Party USA in 1923 and lasted for more than two decades. While it taught party doctrine, it also offered a general education course for trade union activists such as Nelson. The Workers School also inspired many communist training centers throughout America: such as the Chicago Workers School and New Workers School. It merged with the Party&rsquo;s Jefferson School of Social Science in 1944.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the Great Depression, the couple began working full time for the Communist Party: organizing strikes all throughout the country before moving back to Eastern Pennsylvania. Their party experienced incredible growth during this time due to the global economic failure. As it gained momentum, Nelson&rsquo;s career as Party Leader also saw advances.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe two were sent to Moscow in 1931 so Nelson could study Party doctrine at the Lenin School. He served as a courier for the Communist International (Comintern) and delivered funds to Communist Parties in Germany, Switzerland, and China. When they returned in 1933, Nelson continued his activist work with anthracite miners in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen news of the Spanish Civil War broke out, Comintern recruited thousands of international volunteers to fight against Franco&rsquo;s Facist uprising. Nelson was quick to join in 1937. He embarked on the Queen Mary from New York and traveled to Spain through France. Before entry, he was detained and imprisoned with two-dozen other volunteers in Perpignan for violating their travel visas. Like the US, many European countries declared neutrality and barred travel into Spain because of the war. They were released three weeks later and promptly crossed the Pyrenees Mountains to join the International Brigade.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInitially working as a political commissar in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (one who raises morale of the troops and educates them on Communist doctrine), he was promoted to the Political Commissar of the Fifteenth Brigade when he showed immense leadership skills after his unit&rsquo;s commander was mortally wounded in the Brunete offensive in July 1937. This commander was Oliver Law, the first African American to command an integrated military unit and Nelson&rsquo;s activist colleague from Chicago. In this position, he was present in the battles of Quinto and Belchite. After sustaining some injuries, he was relocated to Valencia. There he served as an escort to prominent Americans who were visiting Spain. Soon after, he was called back to the states by US Communist Party Leader Earl Browder. He gave a report on the state of the war at the Party&rsquo;s National Committee in New York City, November 1937. Nelson then went on a national tour, raising funds for the Republican government.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the 1940s, he became a high ranking Party member and later promoted to the chairman of the San Francisco Branch. While living on the West Coast, his wife gave birth to two children: Josephine and Robert. 1942 saw Nelson becoming heavily involved in the Manhattan Project, and he held meetings with Communist scientists working at radiation laboratories at Berkeley. Unknownst to him, the FBI were listening to these conversations via wiretaps. Nelson divulged this information to the Soviet Union in 1943, but was only convicted in 1950: fined $10,000 and sentenced to 20 years in prison on account of the 1919 Pennsylvania Sedition Act. By then, Nelson had been elected to the Party&rsquo;s National Board and his family moved back to Pennsylvania. His case was one of many during the turbulent McCarthy Era. He was able to get out on bail, pending appeals. In 1953, coinciding with the Pennsylvania Sedition case, Nelson and five co-defendants were convicted under the Federal Smith Act. During this time he wrote about his experience in Spain (The Volunteers) and about the trial (The Thirteenth Juror).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1956, in Pennsylvania v. Nelson, the Supreme Court overturned the Pennsylvania Sedition Act because the Federal Smith Act superseded it. By 1957, the Government decided to drop all charges, and Nelson left the Communist Party following Krushchev&rsquo;s revealing of the atrocities committed by Stalin. This costed him much of the friendships and social life he&rsquo;d forged over the years. Unable to find employment, he relocated his family to New York where he scraped by working as a carpenter and a cabinetmaker.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNelson joined the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) organization, soon becoming its National Commander in 1963. For the next forty years, he worked as a political activist: denouncing the Vietnam War and providing medical aid to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. The VALB helped establish the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives in 1975 in order to commemorate all those who fought in the war. Two years after Franco&rsquo;s death, Nelson and fellow veterans returned to Spain for the first time in 40 years. Retiring to Truro, Cape Cod with his wife, he published his autobiography in 1992 titled Steve Nelson: American Radical. He continued to support the VALB, wanting to educate the youth about the contributions of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and their fights against Facism. He died on December 11, 1993 when he was 90 years old.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Born on October 23rd, 1904, Evan Biddle Shipman was the middle child of Ellen McGowan Biddle Shipman, a landscape architect, and Louis Evan Shipman, a successful playwright, editor, and essayist. Shipman grew up in the small, quiet town of Plainfield in Sullivan County, New Hampshire. Growing up in a rural atmosphere, Shipman was surrounded by vast swaths of land, teeming with animals, especially horses. This kindled his interest in horses, which his fans would, later on, consider &ldquo;The greatest writer of thoroughbred racing this continent has ever produced.&rdquo; He was born into a wealthy family as both of his parents were renowned professionals in their careers. This allowed him to pursue his early equestrian interests, which would develop into one of his greatest passions later on, along with writing prose.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter graduating from Oak Park-River Forest High School in June 1917, Shipman became a reporter months later. He also enrolled in Groton School, Massachusetts, and Sailsbury, Connecticut schools, but finished at neither. At Groton, he was noted as an &ldquo;omnivorous reader.&rdquo; However, the New England county fair horse racing scene was too tempting for Shipman and he headed for a new chapter of his life in Europe, where he graduated from the University of Louvain in Belgium and earned his Graduate Degree at The Sorbonne in France.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter university, Shipman went back to America, this time settling in 19 Beckman Place, New York City. However, Shipman headed back to Paris from New York in 1924 to reunite with his father. He had a strong relationship with his father, but a strained one with his mother, so it was important for him to stay connected with his father. His father, Louis, was in Paris with him and they often traveled together between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Shipman had a passion for writing, in part, this can be credited to his father, a renowned playwright.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWriting poems was always a passion for Shipman since it came to him naturally, so he always jumped at the opportunity of getting his work published. In Paris, he was on the hunt for an American named Gotham Munson. Munson was an editor for a small magazine and Shipman hoped he could share his poetry with Munson. However, when he arrived at Munson&rsquo;s address, he was greeted by Ernest Hemingway instead. Munson had moved back to America and Hemingway now lived on the second floor above the sawmill at 113 Rue Notre Dame des Champs (address from a letter to Hemingway from Shipman, 29 October 1949). The two hit off instantaneously and their personalities automatically clicked. They then proceeded to spend hours talking openly. This accidental encounter paved the way for a formative friendship with one of the greatest American novelists of all time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHemingway then introduced Shipman to Gertrude Stein, who introduced him to Andre Masson, a penniless young painter with promise. Hemingway, Shipman, and Masson became close friends and formed a close circle of expatriate Americans in Paris during the 1920s. Stein called them &ldquo;a lost generation.&rdquo; In Paris, Shipman was allowed free thought and liberal actions, where in America he could not. Often, in salons where art and literature were spread, alcohol was on the menu. It stimulated creativity and communication among many artists, similar to the Demimondes in Montmartre, France in the mid-19 century. This led to Shipman&rsquo;s heavy drinking habits, often accompanied by fellow friends, usually Hemingway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring this time, Shipman was also dedicated to his writing, publishing poetry in a variety of magazines, including Transition, Scribner&rsquo;s, The Republic and the Nation, and later in The New Yorker and Esquire. His prose mainly reflected his passion for horse racing and in 1935, Scribner published his novel Free For All, which was about the horse harness sport. His first novel was praised by critics but unfortunately sold poorly. Shipman was an expert on harness breeding and frequently drove horses in workouts. His daily schedule usually included attending a thoroughbred track in the afternoon and a trotting track at night.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen Shipman returned to the states, he married Elizabeth Gerwig of Pittsburgh. However, the marriage did not last long as the couple drank heavily. The final straw was Elizabeth&rsquo;s emotional issues, which led to her confinement in a mental hospital. Shipman wrote a poem &ldquo;Mazeppa,&rdquo; most likely attributed to Gerwig, where he illustrates women as flowers, whose sweet voices turn to the harsh and shrill complaining of strumpets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo escape his marital problems, Shipman returned to Paris in 1937 at Hemingway&rsquo;s request. Shipman volunteered to help Hemingway by delivering three ambulances through France into Spain for the Republican Forces fighting Franco. After successfully delivering the ambulances, Shipman returned to France, where he agreed to lead American volunteers for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade back to Spain. Convinced by Hemingway and in a time of conflict after his failed marriage, Shipman agreed to contribute to something bigger than himself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrough a period of heavy restriction on entry into Spain, Shipman had to lead his men through the precipitous Pyrenees Mountains, where many met their downfall. In an attempt to cross the dangerous, rocky terrain of the mountains at night, the group led by Shipman was discovered and arrested by French border guards. They were immediately jailed for six weeks at Toulouse. However, this didn&rsquo;t stop Shipman and he quickly returned to Spain after his stint in jail.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn May 1937, Shipman arrived in Spain to fight with the Loyalists side in the Spanish Civil War and served in XV Brigade, Washington Battalion, and Lincoln-Washington Battalion until July 18th, 1937. Shipman enlisted as an infantryman and showed immense courage on the battlefield. He still kept in touch with his good friend Hemingway, who described him as &ldquo;pale, ragged, limping and profoundly cheerful,&rdquo; even after several months of battling. Shipman often visited Hemingway during his free time, visiting him at his home in Cuba.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShipman fought courageously during the Battle of Jarama and Battle of Brunete. However, on July 17th, 1937, while fighting at the Brunete, Shipman was hit in both thighs by machine-gun bullets from a strafing plane. Despite the injuries, Shipman claims he never felt a thing during the incident since he was unconscious. However, due to Shipman&rsquo;s injuries from the aerial bombardment, he was sent to recover in Madrid, where he spent 4-5 days convalescing, but then transferred to Murcia in August 1937, where he stayed until January 15th, 1938. The injury would stay with Shipman forever as he carried shrapnel fragments in his leg for the rest of his life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter sustaining this injury, Shipman couldn&rsquo;t return to the battlefield immediately, so he contributed in other ways. He worked as an interpreter for the Quartermasters and as a Hospital Commissar and in mid-January. He was also sent to Madrid, where he wrote video scripts for the Voice of Spain. In Spring 1938, he was sent to Barcelona as editor of the Volunteer of Liberty, and later in May, Shipman was discharged and repatriated back to America. The journey back was difficult as Shipman was arrested once again by the French Guarde Mobile for an illegal border crossing into France. Due to Shipman&rsquo;s likable nature, the French officers bought Shipman cognac and tobacco out of their own money and didn&rsquo;t handcuff him as usual. Eventually, Shipman avoided the charges by leaving France for America.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter participating in the Spanish Civil War and contributing greatly to the Republican side, Shipman returned to America on June 21st, 1938, where he immediately hustled his way back to writing. He became a columnist for New York&rsquo;s Morning Telegraph, a renowned newspaper covering professional sports. However, Shipman&rsquo;s calling sent him on a different path, when he then enlisted in World War II, where he was a correspondent. He was also sergeant major of the Sixteenth Armored Division&rsquo;s Sixteenth Regiment and was with the 787th Tank Battalion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter World War II, Shipman became more invested in his writing and was highly regarded as a horse-racing columnist and writer. Due to his keen observation and technical knowledge of horseracing, he was extremely important in the horseracing industry. He was later made a featured columnist of the Morning Telegraph, free to write whatever he wanted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy the time Shipman was 50, he was considered &ldquo;a fine ruin of a man,&rdquo; but this didn&rsquo;t prevent him from continuing his passion in the horse racing tracks. To this day, there is a horse race named after Shipman called the Evan Shipman Handicap (NYB).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShipman&rsquo;s health eventually deteriorated and he died of cancer in 1957 in New York Hospital. He was then buried in his family cemetery in Plainfield, New Hampshire. Though Shipman died at 53, the impact the Spanish Civil War had on him was life-changing and one that he never forgot. Writing to his friend Hemingway, who he managed to stay tight with even through a long-distance relationship, he described himself as &ldquo;in a bad state in many ways, both discouraged and confounded,&rdquo; before the war but by the time he journeyed home, though, he was a different man. &ldquo;After such a long time, I feel a real eagerness for work. Again I have confidence in myself.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Samuel Kirchenbaum was born on November 16, 1906 in New York City. His parents, Max and Yetta Kirchenbaum, were Russian immigrants who arrived in the United States in search of a brighter future at the turn of the 20th century, escaping the widespread poverty and starvation that existed in Russia during the late 1800s. Growing up with two brothers and two sisters and witnessing his parents strive for freedom and liberty, these values were imprinted on Samuel. There is no information about what school Samuel went to, or what job he had, but it can be inferred that after experiencing the Great Depression in the early 1930s, Samuel felt disillusioned with the United States and capitalism, seeing the poverty and starvation that his parents had tried to escape, all over again in the United States. This likely pushed Samuel towards communism, and when he learned of the conflict taking place in Spain, Kirchenbaum felt strongly about fighting against fascism in Spain. Kirchenbaum received his passport, with the number 375018, on March 15, 1937, and it listed his address as 1507 Kings Highway, Brooklyn, New York.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKirchenbaum sailed for Spain on April 21, 1937 aboard the Queen Mary, and arrived in Spain on May 5, 1937. He was part of the Botwin Company, a subunit of the Palafox Battalion of the International Brigades and of Jews who had completed the short training course but had not yet been placed in a combat force. The Company&rsquo;s flag bore the words &ldquo;For your freedom and ours,&rdquo; showing how the main motivation for Kirchenbaum and the other Jewish volunteers he was with was to fight for freedom and to eliminate injustice. As a member of the Botwin Company, Kirchenbaum participated in battle on the Extremadura Front in February 1938, being one of the 20 only remaining survivors out of the original 120, and he participated in the Ebro offensive in July 1938.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn October 1938, the Spanish government ordered the withdrawal of the International Brigades, so surviving volunteers crossed the border into France, typically becoming unwanted guests of the French government, and most were interned in detention camps in southwest France set up by French authorities. Kirchenbaum eluded capture and imprisonment after the fall of France to Nazi Germany in the summer of 1940 during World War II, and he was joined by other former Botwin Company fighters Abraham Lissner and Leon Pakin to form the Jewish &ldquo;Second Unit&rdquo; which achieved considerable fame for its bold actions against Nazi occupiers. Kirchenbaum played an important role in the Jewish second detachment of the FTP-MOI, the migrant division of the Francs-tireurs et partisans resistance organization. He was the leader of the Jewish detachment of the FTP-MOI, which consisted mainly of Polish Jews. Kirchenbaum and the Jewish detachment targeted Jewish workshops working for Germans on May 31 and June 29, 1942. There is information that Kirchenbaum returned to the United States on July 2, 1938 aboard the President Harding, and Samuel is listed as Sevek Kirchenbaum, so he may have changed his name to conceal his identity, since Samuel is a name of Hebrew origin.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter returning to the United States, Kirchenbaum married Ruth Kirchenbaum and had a daughter named Renee Kirchenbaum. He later married Judith Kirchenbaum, whom he stayed with until his death on November 21, 1993 in Miami, Florida. Kirchenbaum was buried in the Beth David Cemetery.</p>\r\n",

His parents moved to brooklyn and were active in the communist party when he was young. He has one sister, Lenora Marcia White (1929-1991). He dreamed of becoming an actor and went to California when he was 16 to fulfill this dream. He was an extra in a few films (trying to find the names of these but they are not anywhere online) and a member of the New Theatre League. He also worked as a truck driver and a butcher for short periods of time, and he was a member of the Communist Party of the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe sailed to spain on 27 May 1937 on the Paris ship and crossed the Pyrenees Mountains to serve in the International Brigade. White was in the 86th Brigade and was a rifleman and machine gunner, and fought in several battles including the battles of Belchite and Teruel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nMilton White kept a diary of his experiences throughout his life which is now stored in the NYU Tamiment Library as &ldquo;The Milton White Files&rdquo;. Among these he has poems, songs and recountings from life especially of the Spanish Civil War. He also wrote about people he met in Spain whose lives were touched by the war, including a particularly emotionally moving monologue about a mother he met whose children were hit in a civilian bombing. His poems were written in three languages (English, Spanish and Russian), and he wrote songs and plays in English and Spanish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOn 20 December 1938 Milton White returned to the United States aboard the Ausonia.

At the time, communism thrived in New York City. Abraham Sirotof was one of the 38,000 communist party members in NYS in 1938, and he lived right at the heart of the communist wave in NYC. Madison Square Garden held communist meetings with as many as 20,000 participants, and the annual May Day parades had an audience of tens of thousands. The Communist Party involved itself with leftist politics and labeled itself as the &ldquo;20th-Century Americanism.&rdquo; Abraham Sirotof was unemployed for 16 years, which could have fostered his involvement with the Communist Party. In NYC, the communist party was a proponent of unionism for a variety of job fields, such as the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT). The IUPAT would&rsquo;ve supported painters like Abraham Sirotof through unemployment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter nine years of being a member of the communist party, Abraham Sirotof decided to join the XVth Abraham Lincoln Brigade (ALB) to support the Republic, arriving in Spain on July 16, 1938, when the Nationalists pushed into the Province of Valencia. He was a member of the Lincoln-Washington Battalion Company 1. Sirotof&rsquo;s only battle with the Republicans was at the Battle of the Ebro. In a response to the Nationalist push, the Republic launched an all-out offensive. Sirotof received little training and was sent into the fray. On the evening of July 24, 1938, he, amongst other members of his company, crept through the mud and reeds towards the banks of the Ebro to distract the Nationalist armies that were advancing towards Valencia. The Nationalist armies were caught off guard, which allowed for a successful Republican attack. Abraham Sirotof and the other soldiers were trained to do specific tasks as a part of their rudimentary training, and the Republican forces were able to coordinate the maneuver. Despite the knowledge that the Nationalist forces would be near impossible to totally defeat, Sirotof was still in good spirits and focused on the Republic&rsquo;s goal of seizing, entrenching, and holding territory. They fought fiercely, and on August 1 the XVth ALB launched an attack at Hill 481 in front of Gandesa, leading to many casualties. The Nationalists had backed the Republic back to the Ebro.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn September 21, Negr&iacute;n announced the withdrawal of the International Brigades to the League of Nations in hopes that the foreign powers backing the Nationalists would follow suit. Sirotof&rsquo;s battalion left on September 23, 1938. Sirotof returned to the US on December 20, 1938 above the RMS Ausonia with fifty other ALB members, such as Arthur H. Landis. He moved to the Bronx with his wife, Fanny, and his four-year-old son, Robert, by 1940. They lived on Brook Avenue in South Bronx, and Sirotof supported his family on his painter salary. He also served in the Armed Forces in WWII. In the 1950s, he moved to Bloomfield Essex, New Jersey and lived on Olive Street. He remarried Evelyn Sirotof (nee Garlock) and had four children. However, there is the possibility that the remarried Sirotof differs from the veteran Sirotof.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbraham Sirotof passed away in May, 1963, in New York.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Daniel Rivas y Betancourt was born on September 5, 1910. He was born in Florida but there is a slight possibility that he&rsquo;s born in Cuba and immigrated to Florida. In the late 1920s, tobacco unions began working towards unification, leading to mass meetings at the Socialist Hall in the Upper East Side. These events featured rallies and workshops often supported by active members of the Socialist Party. This most likely lead him to joining similar political parties and organizations.<br />\r\nDaniel eventually moved to New York, where he lived at either 315 6th Street Park Slope or 778 Prospect Avenue Windsor Terrace. This general area consisted of a lot of housing at the time: Park Slope there were more mansions and row houses due to Prospect Park being nearby.<br />\r\nDaniel identified with several political parties and organizations, including the CP USA, which he joined in 1932, the Spanish CP, the American Federation of Workers, and the Cafeteria Workers Union.<br />\r\nIn January 1937, Daniel sailed to Spain aboard the Champlain and arrived there on January 12, 1937. He joined the International Brigade at the age of 27 becoming a soldier in the XV Brigade, Lincoln Battalion, Company 1, Section 3, Centuria Antonio Guitaras. The Lincoln Brigade was often looked down upon for the soldiers were young and had no experience in war. He served as the political delegate for his company for his bilingual skills. With little training and many speeches, Daniel was sent out to fight in the battle of Jarama. In February 1937, he was one of the many wounded in action, suffering a bullet wound in the chest.<br />\r\nWhile recovering from his wounds, Daniel served as the Responsible for Cuban comrades in Murcia. He was later appointed the Administrator for the University Hospital in Murcia, where he faced numerous administrative and executive challenges in treating thousands of wounded soldiers. There would be many people coming into the hospital for treatment and there was a limited amount of supplies. Furthermore, there was no sanitation which complicated matters of hygiene for patients.<br />\r\nDaniel returned to the front lines and fought at Quinto and Belchite. In the battle, the Republicans were able to gain control over Belchite but the village was decimated and thousands of people had died. It was reported that he was wounded in Belchite in September 1937. According to some sources, he continued to serve and was ultimately killed in action during the Retreats in Gandesa in April 1938. Daniel may have been of the many Republican soldiers who were trapped on the wrong side of the river and was captured or died trying to swim across the River Ebro. However it was also reported that Daniel returned to Cuba on May 27, 1939, aboard the Orduna. It could be his remains.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Dr. Sidney Leon Vogel was born on April 28th, 1904. His father, Heinrick Vogel, was also a physician. Vogel&rsquo;s parents were Jewish immigrants from Germany that immigrated to America, where Vogel would eventually be born in New York City. Vogel lived on 329 W. 85th Street on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike his father, Vogel took an interest in medicine. Dr. Sidney Leon Vogel received a medical degree from the University of Michigan in 1927. As part of his medical career, Vogel underwent an internship at the Manhattan State Hospital, which was a psychiatric hospital for patients with mental health or behavioral conditions. He continued to practice general medicine in the 1930s in New York City. Through his medical work, as well as meeting other medical colleagues who shared progressive views about the Spanish Republic, Vogel supported the Medical Bureau of the Friends of the Spanish Democracy, which was a humanitarian group affiliated with the Lincoln Battalion. Groups such as the American Medical Bureau to Save Spanish Democracy recruited medical professionals such as doctors, nurses, and ambulance drivers to offer medical assistance to wounded soldiers fighting for the Spanish Republic. Unlike those that supported America&rsquo;s non-interventionist policy during the war, organizations such as the American Medical Bureau wanted to become involved in the Spanish Civil War, recruiting health workers to go to Spain and treat patients fighting for the Republic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn May 29, 1937, Dr. Sidney Leon Vogel volunteered to treat patients in Spain, having the title of captain when going to Murica. Vogel was the director of the Caso Roja hospital, where he supervised the hospital and continued to practice surgery. As Francisco Franco&rsquo;s Nationalist army advanced their influence on Spain, Vogel was then transferred to Santa Coloma and Matar&oacute;s. Vogel aided in the evacuation of the Catalan zone and had to leave the Caso Rojo hospital during the evacuation. Medical professionals such as Vogel had to make decisions on which hospitals patients should go to depending on the severity of their wounds. The Front Hospital was for patients with the most severe injuries. They needed emergency procedures such as amputation, and often had to be quickly transferred to other hospitals to make room for more urgent patients that also needed emergency procedures. With limited supplies and stretchers, emergency workers such as ambulance drivers had to quickly transport patients to different hospitals with the threat of potential bombing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the war continued, Vogel was then transferred to work at other hospitals, such as those in Matar&oacute; or near Barcelona. When the International Brigades withdrew from fighting in October 1938, medical workers such as Vogel continued to stay in Spain to oversee the wounded being transferred out of Spain. On August 4th, 1938, Vogal was appointed the Director of the Mataro Hospital. During his time in Spain, Vogel wrote about the blood transfusion system, admiring the efficiency and precision of the Spanish staff in treating patients. He believed the efficiency of the blood transfusion system during the war was a testament to how important organization is in utilizing war medicine to save lives. A few months before the Spanish Civil War ended, Vogel left Spain to go to Paris in January, 1939, where he then went back to New York. He returned to the United States boarding the Ile de France on February 21, 1939.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven after the events of the Spanish Civil War, Dr. Vogel continued to volunteer as a medical professional to help the US Army. After the events of Pearl Harbor in 1941, Dr. Sidney Leon Vogel volunteered to serve in the US Army&rsquo;s North African and Italian campaigns. He was one of the few medical staff with psychiatric experience, such as having worked in the Manhattan State Hospital for psychiatric patients years prior. Thus, Vogel was often assigned victims that were suffering from shellshock or post-traumatic stress disorder. After World War II, Vogel was able to retrain as a psychiatrist under the GI bill, which allowed veterans to pursue higher education. Vogel continued to research group therapy and alcoholism, publishing several articles in the 1950s about researching group psychotherapy with people struggling with alcoholism. Vogue continued to practice psychiatry in New York City until his death on April 1st, 1986.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Conrad Kaye was born on March 19, 1908 in Russia. It is not known when he immigrated to the US or when he was married, but he received his American citizenship in 1932 from the Superior Court of New York City. He lived at 305 West 19th Street in Chelsea with his wife, and worked primarily as a food worker and a meat cutter. He also listed an alternate residence at 323 First Avenue in Gramercy Park. Expecting to see the American Dream unfold around him, Conrad was disheartened to see that his financial situation in the US wasn&rsquo;t much better than his homeland. He grew tired of his life working as a menial laborer, and yearned to do something about the ideals he believed in. When he received word from fellow unionists that many were volunteering to fight for freedom in Spain, he felt that even dying for freedom was better than participating in an illusion of it. Only five years after attaining his citizenship, Conrad chose, like many others in the city, to leave his wife and family to support the Spanish Republic. He applied for and received a passport on March 15, 1937. He left just a month later on April 28, sailing on the Normandie to Spain. He arrived on May 30.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy that time, the Abraham Lincoln Brigade had already sustained heavy losses during the Battle of Jarama. Conrad received haphazard and chaotic training, most of which was composed of various speeches in almost every language besides English. After barely two months, Conrad, alongside his fellow Americans, were organized as the George Washington Battalion, fresh reinforcements for the XVth Brigade, or the XV Brigada Internacional. They were commanded by Mirko Markovic. Conrad and his battalion went into action alongside the Lincoln Battalion on the second day of the Brunete Offensive. Their job was to attack the north end of the village Villanueva de la Canada, while the British and Dimitrov battalions attacked from the south. Conrad saw heavy fighting in securing the town, and did not get much of a rest before being sent out with the rest of the XVth Brigade to assault the dreaded Mosquito Ridge. Despite being turned away again and again by Nationalist troops, Conrad and his fellow Americans were told to repeat their attack. Conrad saw many of his friends and brothers in arms die that day. After failing to take the region, Conrad discovered that the Lincoln Commander, Oliver Law, who was already the replacement commander for the dead previous commander Robert Hale Merriman, had also been killed. Both the Washington and the Lincoln Battalions had suffered such heavy losses that they were reorganized into a single battalion - the Lincoln Washington Battalion. However, Conrad, along with his surviving Americans after the war, only referred to it as the Lincoln Battalion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConrad had no time to recover before being thrust into the next piece of action. He was promoted to Intendencia, or Quartermaster of the base, and would be overseeing training and supplies for the entire Lincoln Battalion. This did not mean he would not have to fight. He marched alongside the rest of his friends to the Aragon Front, a series of offensives and battles that were meant to push the Nationalists out of Spanish Republican territory. They arrived in August. At Quinto, Conrad did not have to do much shooting - the Americans were led into the town as a second assault following Spanish-controlled Russian T26 tanks. But at Belchite, the fighting was much heavier. Close-quarters, house-to-house, ugly, brutal fighting. For two weeks hundreds of men died fighting for one piece of territory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConrad had less than a month to rest before the Lincoln Battalion was sent to the next town. On October 13, the entire XVth Brigade did battle at Fuentes de Ebro. The Spanish Battalion led the attack with Russian tanks - and did not properly coordinate their advance with the infantry. The assault fell apart and became a slaughter. All Conrad could do was make sure as many of his brothers got to safety as possible. The battle was over quickly, as they had been turned away almost immediately, but the Lincoln brigade mercifully had fewer casualties than usual. After Fuentes de Ebro, the XVth Brigade was ordered to retreat to a reserve spot where they could rest and recover. It was the first time they had been given the chance to do so since Jarama Valley.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the few months they had to relax, Conrad was appointed Rank Ensign, or second lieutenant, and Base Quartermaster. He was placed in charge of all the supplies and training of the troops in the International Brigade. This was a hard job during the cold winter months, when food was scarce and warmth scarcer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn late December of 1937, the Lincoln Battalion was called to hold the recently captured city of Teruel. They spent Christmas freezing in one of the coldest winters Spain had seen in years. Conrad and the rest of the battalion were defending positions that overlooked Teruel, and began calling it the &ldquo;North Pole,&rdquo; because of the cold. It was not long before the Nationalists began attacking the city with all their strength. The XVth Brigade lost two whole companies trying to hold Republican territory. For three weeks Conrad sat in the trenches, freezing and shooting desperately at a vastly better manned and equipped army. The Lincoln Battalion was pulled out for rest, but before they could reach their rest areas, they were ordered to a different side of the front, in an offensive that was meant to take some of the Nationalist pressure off of bombarding Teruel. Exhuasted, Conrad and his brothers attacked the Nationalist base at Segura de los Banos, but no Nationalist forces were diverted from Teruel. They were called back, and took up reserve positions in Aragon, waiting for the enemy&rsquo;s attack.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn March, the Nationalist army cut through Republican forces and drove them to the sea. Conrad lost many of his brothers during the Great Retreat. The Lincoln Battalion was continuously dispersed and reformed as Republican forces continued to give ground. Robert Merriman and Dave Doran, the two commanders of the Lincoln Battalion, had gone missing. Anyone who was lost was assumed to have been captured and executed by the enemy. No one was in charge. It was chaos. The remnants of the Republican army barely made it to the far side of the Ebro River. Conrad knew, then, that it was over. They had lost. Almost all the brave young volunteers from New York he had met on the Normandie were dead or gone. Facism had won in Spain, at least for now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConrad did not stay with his brothers in the Lincoln Battalion for the Ebro Offensive. He returned to the US on April 14, 1938.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut Conrad Kaye never gave up the fight against facism and tyranny. Just a few years later, he enlisted in the army to fight in World War II. He fought the Nazis bravely, was promoted to Sergeant, and won the Bronze and Silver Star. He returned home alive and well, a noble soldier to the end.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt some point later during his life, he moved to Mexico City. He died there, in June of 1980.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Albert Robbins aka Isidore Cohen was born on December 4th, 1909 in New York City. He spent 3 years at the City College of New York, in the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC), making him ready to serve his country. He became a seaman and was a part of the National Maritime Union. He joined the Youth Communist League, the Spanish Communist Party, and the Communist party in the early 1930&rsquo;s. He received his passport on February 10th, 1937, setting him up for being able to go overseas to fight. Being in the Spanish Communist Party most likely taught him about Spain and the Spanish culture. He believed the principles of the republic were worth fighting for and arrived in Spain on March 17th, 1937. He served with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and the George Washington Battalion. He was an adjutant in the 3rd Company and served at Brunete. He was wounded in action and ultimately returned to the US on July 2nd, 1938. He died on January 17th, 1987 in New York and was buried in the Bronx.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Jewish were incredibly prominent in the International Brigade. Although they were thought of as submissive, they were actually incredibly committed and went to fight Franco as a war against facism. Cohen most likely was swept up in this fervor to prove his community wrong and also to put a foot down first to stop facism and its incredibly anti-semitic beliefs. He contributed greatly to the war effort along with all the other Jews participating and this was only erased by non-Jewish war veterans not looking favorably among their jewish allies, thus influencing Spanish Civil War historians to exclude the Jewish.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a resident of New York City, Robbins was incredibly interconnected with the city and its culture, especially the Jewish Community. He believed in the cause of stopping facism early on and enlisted into the International Brigade. Like many other Jews, he came to face the marginalization in the forces formed by the Old-fashioned Stalinists. This anti-Semitism was seen as a minimal disruptance however, as the Jewish Community agreed that the dangers of facism were much more pressing. Rising to the rank of adjutant, Robbins served at the battle of Brunete. It was a Republican attempt to alleviate pressure on the capital by diverting rebel forces from the north to Brunete. The diversion was successful but the Republicans suffered heavy losses as a result and it led to the Republicans being hurt greatly. Robbins most likely recognized the toll it took on the Republican army men and supplies as well as the political harm on the Communists as they failed to prevent the encroachment of the nationalists on the north. As a result, when he was wounded shortly after, he was most likely still filled with vigor to fight for the cause but also recognition that the fight against facism was lost at this battle and they would have to regroup and live to fight another day.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Manuel Estevez Barrena was a Spanish American born to Manuel Sanchez and Sergia Barrena on Oct 18th, 1918 in Plymouth, California. He and his mother moved to what would later be a fascist part of the central zone in 1932 with a Spanish passport, while his father and brother remained in the US. This forced him to be fluent in both Spanish and English, which is what would allow him to enlist as an interpreter later in the war.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen the war broke out, he was still a student, but despite this, he enlisted in the Column Rosal, an anarchist anti-fascist militia set up by the CNT. Most evidence suggests that he is an anarchist, from references in anarchist books to his enlistment in almost exclusively anarchist units, although it isn&rsquo;t certain. The Column Rosal was later divided into multiple army regiments, one of which was the 60th Mixed Brigade, a racially integrated unit. He was a sergeant in this brigade, and would fight in Casa de Campo (an important site during the Siege of Madrid), where he suffered a minor wound, and the first attack on Teruel, Brunete.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn March 1938, he transferred to the International Brigade as an interpreter, the reason for which is unclear but it is likely due to the devastating defeat the 60th Brigade suffered in the Ebro Offensive. This was lucky for him, as the unit would then be almost completely wiped out in the Catalonian Offensive, and those that hadn&rsquo;t deserted or been shot escaped to France, where they would then be forced into prison camps. After serving as an interpreter for about 6 months, he then went into Officer Training School (OTS), and was then promoted to a Lieutenant. In 1939, after he left Spain, he was nominated to become a distinguished soldier, along with 20 other members of his unit. However, it was unlikely he received this honor, as he was ranked 20th out of the 20 people and was probably cut due to the sheer number of nominations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn December 20th, 1938, he left Spain on the ship Ausonia, but his mother would remain in Spain, and live (and presumably die) under Franco&rsquo;s rule. He likely went to live with his dad and brother in Manhattan, who were staying in a hotel room on West St. as their &lsquo;permanent&rsquo; residence, and would shortly after move to New Jersey. He stayed in the US through a Certificate of Identity (which oddly enough he put the hotel room as his address, despite the fact that he wasn&rsquo;t living in it for long at all), meaning he wasn&rsquo;t a citizen, which is one of the main reasons as to why there are so few records of him after the war. After the outbreak of WWII, he would go on to fight on the eastern front with the American troops, although the records for his involvement in this event have not been made public yet. He died in Kearney Town, NJ on April 21, 1991.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Aaron Lopoff was born on January 25th, 1914 in NYC. He attended Texas A&amp;M University for one year and NYU for an unspecified amount of time. In Lopoff&rsquo;s early teens, he &ldquo;hoboed&rdquo; all around the States, worked his way part way through college and &ldquo;Then I sort of got bored&rdquo; as he would say in which he then made a living by writing fiction stories for magazines. On August 11, 1937 when Lopoff was a young man 23 years of age, he sailed on Queen Mary to Spain for the Spanish Civil war. At this time, according to Lopoff&rsquo;s passport that he received on August 3rd, 1937 his address was listed as 219 East 12th Street, NYC (Spring Valley, New York). He ultimately arrived in Spain on August 22, 1937.Aaron Lopoff served with the XV BDE, Lincoln-Washington BN, Co.2 as Lieutenant, company commander and adjutant. Lopoff was a respected man, his anti-fascist understanding along with his desire to lead his company better made the Command of the Lincoln to consider Aaron Lopoff as one of its most experienced and responsible leaders. As Lopoff used to say: &ldquo;When you have a lot of other guys to worry about, you can&rsquo;t be afraid for yourself&rdquo; Lopoff was the type of leader that wanted to spare as much of his comrades as he possibly can. These characteristics made the people around Lopoff respect him as they can feel the sense of responsibility that this man has. On the night of August 17th, 1938 during the Ebro Offensive on Hill 666, Lopoff was wounded in action- receiving 3 m.g bullets to the head, and destroyed one eye which may have resulted in the loss of the other. Aaron Lopoff later died in the hospital due to his wounds. Lopoff was single prior to his death, there were no records of him being married and he does not have any known offspring. Aaron Lopoff was a brother figure to Alvah Bessie, another famous veteran that served in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Lopoff served as Bessie&rsquo;s company commander and most of what we&rsquo;ve learned of Lopoff comes from Bessie&#39;s notebook that later on was published.</p>\r\n",

During his younger life, he spent 14 months in the United States Army, while also devoting time to attend classes in order to prepare for the entrance exam to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Ultimately, Adler passed the physical exam but failed the written exam by two credits in an elimination competition, causing him to leave the army in disappointment. After that, he decided to go to college, where he received a bachelors of science. Following his time in college, Adler became a high school physical education teacher, a career he held for seven years before leaving for Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1933, he joined the Communist Party, which he dropped out of in 1934 for eight to nine months and rejoined in early 1935. The Communist Party was very popular in New York City and members would organize mass meetings, promote unionization, and fight racism. At that time, Adler lived in the East Village of Manhattan, at 197 2nd Avenue. During the early 1930s, the East Village was home to the largest &ldquo;Hooverville&rdquo; in New York, which was self-governed. Adler would have only lived mere blocks away from it. In what was known as &ldquo;No Luck Town&rdquo;, talk of communism was strictly prohibited, but the actual neighborhood functioned very similarly to a socialist society, as food was shared amongst residents. Exposure to this would have provided an interesting perspective for a Communist like Adler. After war broke out in Spain, his experiences with the Communist Party and with life made him decide to take action.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn March 10th, 1937, Adler sailed to Spain aboard the Queen Mary. He arrived on March 25th, where he was sent to train in Tarazona, which was known for its cold and miserable conditions. Despite that, he excelled and was appointed leader of his group while in training. However, he knew that his group was likely to be absorbed by the American Company, which was stationed there. Due to Adler&rsquo;s past experiences both with the army and with his job as a physical education teacher, he decided that he would be a valuable asset to the Republic if he were to learn proper military tactics. He proceeded to send a letter to request for transfer to the officer&rsquo;s training school at Albacete. It is probable that his request was denied, as he deserted soon after, likely frustrated as the situation somewhat mirrored his rejection from West Point.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile his time in the Spanish Civil War met its end before it began, Adler&rsquo;s military experiences were far from over. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II from January 8th, 1941 to October 11th, 1946. After his service, he led a quiet life until his death on April 25th, 1996 in Miami, Florida.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Yrjo Johannes Aalto also known as Yjro John Aalto was born January 27th, 1903 in Finland. The war of 1918 in Finland was the first time Aalto was given the opportunity to fight for what he believed in. The war was between white Finland, who opposed socialism, and Red Finland, who were for socialism and established it in some parts of the country. Aalto joined Red Finland, also known as the Finnish Socialist Workers\u2019 Republic, and served in the Red Guards at 15 years old. Although Red Finland lost the war, it was likely that Aalto was pardoned like the majority of reds were in late 1918. <br /><br />In 1923 there was an especially large number of Finns immigrating to the United States, this fits into the time frame between 1918 and 1937 when he could have arrived in America. He became a permanent resident of NYC, he could have likely lived in Brooklyn\u2019s \u201cFinntown\u201d as it was already home for over 10,000 Finns. Today this area is known as Sunset Park. Aalto was an unmarried seaman, which meant that he was a part of a boat\u2019s crew. Most likely he worked on a merchant ship or a transportation ship that docked in New York Harbour. <br /><br />Even after all the years since the Finnish Civil War, Aalto still adamant about being Antifascist and boarded the Washington on July 28th, 1937 setting sail to Spain along with the other American volunteers who heard about Spain's need for international soldiers. Aalto was 34 years old which was unusual for a volunteer, because most were younger. This was most likely because of the ability to easily remove themselves from their life in America to fight in another country. Those passionate about the cause who were older could have had families and/or stable jobs thus would not have the privilege to leave to fight. Aalto was an unmarried seaman, so he likely did not have too many strings tying him down to life in America.<br /><br />Aalto served in the XV International Brigade, the official name for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Aalto was a part of the Machine Gun Company which was a unit that supported the main battalions with weaponry. After two months of training, in February the Brigade was put into battle very much unprepared. The XV International Brigade lost a large number of soldiers in the first fight, but Aalto survived. He then joined forces with the Mackenzie-Papineau BN which were a group of Canadians part of the XV International Brigade.<br /><br />At the Battle of the Elbro Aalto received citation for his conduct during battle. The nationalists managed to cause the republicans to disperse, the Lincoln Brigade was split. Aalto went to a hospital in Taranc\u00f3n because he had unknown illnesses. Around this time there were outbreaks of typhoid, spotted fever, smallpox, and bacterial dysentery. After Aalto recovered he requested to transfer to the guerrillas who were small armed groups mostly active in mountain areas. Aalto attended training. He was then sent to Albacete, which was an entirely republican controlled region, where he awaited orders. There he got drunk and was jailed for intoxication. Then he was transferred again to the 129th BN established in 1937, which was a mixed brigade of international units and soldiers. It was also known as the Forty Nations Brigade. He returned to the front while he retreated with the XIII BDE. He deserted them to the XV BDE and rejoined the Canadian Mackenzie-Papineau BN.<br /><br />After the unit retreated Aalto attempted to get to Barcelona, but he was caught. Aalto was sent to Tarragona Camp which was a labor camp and prison. He witnessed the execution of three Finns, but was likely spared due to the sheer lack of soldiers on the Republic\u2019s side. After May 1, 1938 he returned to the XV BDE which was likely due to the dire need for more soldiers on the losing Republic\u2019s side. Then he spent 12 days in hospital due to stomach pains. Stomach pains were common during this period, especially for those at war because they can be caused by increased anxiety. He returned to the front and remained with Co. 2 until he was wounded in action on July 27, 1938. Finally he left Spain on October 19, 1938 with a group of 200 wounded veterans, and likely went back to New York.<br /></p>",

        "data": "<p>Grace Miriam Margulis was born August 25, 1910 in St. Louis, Missouri. Her parents were Jewish immigrants from Russia. In the period between 1880 and 1920, many anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire caused Jewish populations to flee and immigrate to the United States and the State of Israel. Like many other European immigrants, Margulis&rsquo; parents passed through Ellis Island in New York, and eventually settled in St. Louis, Missouri.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1936, the coup d&#39;etat against the Popular Front-led Republic led to the eruption of civil war in Spain. As the rebels, or the Nationalist forces, allied with fascist dictators like Hitler and Mussolini, many from outside of Spain saw a need to join the Republicans in their fight to uphold democracy. One such organization was the American Medical Bureau, a humanitarian aid institution that provided medical aid to wounded Republicans. The AMB was based in New York City, and many of its members were members of the Communist Party. Margulis likely traveled to New York City after joining the Communist Party. She became a registered nurse in 1931, and worked in her hometown St. Louis. In the latter 1930s, many youth and medical professionals, particularly those of Jewish background, sought to contribute to resistance against rising fascism in Europe.The case of Spain was an instance in which they could do their part, and many, like Margulis, left their homes and their careers to volunteer in Spain. The AMB served with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, and sent doctors, nurses, and ambulance drivers to hospitals as well as the front lines in Spain. Grace Miriam Margulis served as a nurse with the AMB and departed from New York City in October, 1937.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDue to non-intervention policies from the United States government, few American volunteers arrived after September, 1937. Margulis was one of the lucky few to arrive afterward, and members of the AMB were able to sail directly to Spain. In Spain, the AMB worked with hospitals and medical centers of the Spanish Military Medical Services(Cuerpo de Sanidad). Members served in Madrid, Valencia, and frontline locations in middle Spain. Margulis largely remained in Madrid, and was a part of the International Volunteers of Liberty (Voluntarios Internacionales de la Libertad). She served from November 1937 to the following August with other medical professionals of the Health Corps and worked primarily in military hospitals. Hospitals that she aided include the American Hospital of Saelices and Villa Paz, the Hospital of Mataro, and the Provincial Hospital of Madrid. During the time Margulis was in Spain, there were many tense battles being fought around Madrid. The Battles of Jarama, Brunete, and Guadalajara had occurred earlier in the year in areas near the capital and the Nationalists&rsquo; attempt to siege Madrid, as well as the Republicans&rsquo; efforts to resist, remained in a staunch stalemate. The city of Madrid experienced constant bombing, and the medical professionals treated civilians and injured fighters of the war. Margulis served the city of Madrid during the Battle of Teruel in winter 1937, where both sides suffered over a hundred thousand casualties.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Republicans&rsquo; struggle became more apparent in 1938 as supplies ran low and morale lowered. The Nationalists have reached the Mediterranean in an area near Castellon, and Catalonia was cut off from the rest of the Republic. In a final attempt, the International Brigades and the Spanish Republican soldiers launched the Ebro Offensive. Though it was initially successful, the Republicans had difficulty holding down the line, and were ultimately defeated. In the aftermath, Prime Minister Juan Negrin ordered all international volunteers home in the fall of 1938. He had done this in an attempt to go along with non-intervention and desist international aid on all sides toward the Spanish Civil War. This was virtually ineffective on the Nationalist side, as Franco continued working with other fascist dictators. With defeat and the downfall of the Spanish Republic imminent, members of the International Brigade were celebrated in a final parade in the city of Barcelona before they returned to their homes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMembers of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade returned to the United States. Margulis returned in the winter of 1938 on the SS President Harding back to New York City. She returned to St. Louis, Missouri and continued to work as a nurse. Back in her hometown, Margulis met and eventually married Harry John Day. Day, a fellow member of the Abraham Lincoln Brigades, was also a member of the Communist Party who sought to combat fascism. He had entered Spain through France and worked as a concrete finisher in the War, serving from February 1937 to July 1938, when he returned aboard the Champlain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs U.S.-Soviet tensions escalated in the latter 1940s, American communists and many veterans of the Lincoln Brigade faced questioning from the government for their identities. Both Margulis and Day remained on the Scope of Soviet Activity watchlist in the United States due to their communist affiliation. They had three children: Michael Day, Susan Day, and Lois Day. Grace Miriam Margulis took her own life in June, 1950 and rests in Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery, University City, St. Louis, Missouri. She is survived by her grandchildren.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Michael &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; Patrick McLaughlin was an Irish-Canadian-American who fought alongside the Republic against Franco&rsquo;s fascist forces during the Spanish Civil War in the Abraham Lincoln Battalion and Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, which were in the Fifteenth (XV) International Brigade. McLaughlin was born to a devout Catholic Irish family on September 24, 1890, in Ballyhaunis, County Mayo, Ireland. The repercussions of the Irish Famine were still drastic, and Ballyhaunis was still held back in an agrarian, rural society, which resulted in McLaughlin&rsquo;s life in poverty. He was the son of James McLaughlin and Mary Nolan. He had a large family, with four other siblings (Delia McDonough, Bernhard McLaughlin, James McLaughlin, and Jack McLaughlin), which was common in rural societies. The socioeconomic disparities in Great Britain, especially between the British and the Irish, would eventually spur him to be a passionate Marxist communist, thereby motivating him to fight for the Communist Republican forces on behalf of Canada and America in the Spanish Civil War a few decades later. Not much is recorded about his adolescence or time before his residency in Canada, but it is assumed that he helped his family through agriculture, which was very common in late 19th, early 20th century Ireland. Due to the bucolic nature of Northern Ireland at that time, it is likely he did not get an education. The known schools in Ballyhaunis would be founded in the late 20th century.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As was common with many Irish people, he emigrated elsewhere in hopes of finding employment opportunities and a better standard of living. He moved to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and married Ellen Costello (1894-1974) in 1915. They had four children together: Margaret Stevens (1916-?), John Thomas McLaughlin (1917-2006), Eileen Jordon (1925-?), and John James McLaughlin (1927-?). He was a humble man, working as a coal miner in Canada, seeking political and social clubs to support his large family. Throughout his time in the Western Hemisphere leading up to his involvement in the Spanish Civil War, he would travel to and from Canada and the USA, developing his passion for communism and anti-fascism. Accordingly, he resided in New York City, New York, USA on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He would join the American Federation of Labor in 1918 and become the New York Secretary of the Communist Party of the USA in 1935. Conversely, he was a member of the Communist Party of Canada in 1935.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being spurred by his comrades in the Communist Parties, he became dedicated to the interests of the Popular Front-led Republic in Spain. Still living in poverty, he decided that his calling would be in Spain to resist the evils of fascism and potentially implement communist ideals in the shattered Republic. Along with many other volunteers in the XV International Brigade from NYC, he boarded the <em>Washington</em> on March 10, 1937. It is recorded that he arrived in Spain on April 8, 1937, likely at Albacete, due to the time of his journey and the fact that Albacete was the center for the International Brigades. He was assigned to the Abraham Lincoln Battalion on June 5, 1937, which was predominantly American-composed and named after famous American President Abraham Lincoln. McLaughlin, along with other Canadian immigrants and Canadian natives, named themselves the Mackenzie-Papineau Section, after the famed William Lyon Mackenzie and Louis-Joseph Papineau of Canada, who led the Rebellion of 1837-1838 in Canada.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He first saw action with his comrades during the Brunete Campaign in July 1937, which was a devastating failure for the International Brigades. He witnessed the deaths of many of his peers during that time, and he was badly wounded in his head and hip. After the unfortunate results of the Brunete Campaign, he pushed for the formation of a Canadian Battalion with some of his Canadian comrades, which led to the formal establishment of the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion in July 1937. After being transported to northern Spain, he witnessed his second major battle, the Aragon Offensive in March 1938. He was often characterized as being lighthearted, carefree, drunk, and physically weak by his colleagues, which contributed to his dwindling war performance. This became such an issue that during the Aragon offensive, he was arrested by Republican officials in April 1938 at Las Presas for drunkenness and jailed for 15 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Nationalist forces continuously pressed on the International Brigades, McLaughlin sought to exit the war out of exhaustion and misconduct. He traveled to the Pyrenees mountains and snuck through them to get into France to ultimately return to America. He rode by train all the way up to Le Havre, France, where he would return to New York City clandestinely aboard the <em>Britannic </em>by October 13, 1938.&nbsp;He would become officially naturalized as an American citizen on December 15, 1938. He would stay in the USA for the rest of his life, living a hidden and peaceful life in his humble apartment on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. He died on February 26th, 1974, and he was buried in the Calvary Cemetery of Queens, New York City.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>P.S</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with many volunteers in the Spanish Civil War, there was a lack of photographic records of them; the most that has been discovered at this time for the common soldier would be a group picture, like the one with the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion provided by ALBA&#39;s <em>The Volunteer</em>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://albavolunteer.org/2016/06/jarama-series-canadians-in-the-lincoln-battalion/\" target=\"_blank\">https://albavolunteer.org/2016/06/jarama-series-canadians-in-the-lincoln-battalion/</a>). Unfortunately, this truth holds evident with McLaughlin, whose precise identity has still not been found. From some of the provided portraits in the archives, a considerable amount of volunteers in the group photo could be eliminated as being McLaughlin. Additionally, from contemporaneous, written archives, one could deduce McLaughlin to be the man in the third row because of his short stature and considerably weak physique, as noted by his peers. As the world continues to draw note of the implications of the Spanish Civil War and give a deeper dive into its history and the valiant men and women who fought within it, hopefully, McLaughlin&#39;s identity could be definitively pinpointed. At this moment, though, this unknown person appears to be a plausible&nbsp;candidate for McLaughlin.</p>\r\n",

His father was a communist, influencing his political beliefs later in life. Samuel attended technical school before working as a mechanic in a factory in Odesa, Ukraine for 2 years. From 1917 to 1918, he fought in World War I in the Romanian army. After the war, he was influenced to become a communist in 1918 after listening to a lecture by a political commissar (P.C.) while in his home city of Chisinau. The next year, Samuel joined the Communist Party, even though the party was illegal in Romania. Samuel would go on strikes organized by the party and was arrested for these strikes, spending 9 months locked up in prison. After being released from prison in August 1920, he illegally left the country for the United States with the help of his parents.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe became a naturalized citizen in 1928 and later moved to NYC from Boston. Even in Boston, he had trouble with the law and was arrested, a repeating pattern in his life. In New York City, Samuel became a furrier and was a member of the labor union of furriers located there, called The Fur Workers Industrial Union formed in 1927. The president of the organization was a man named Ben Gold, a notorious communist labor union leader, and Samuel worked under his leadership. The union was formed after they were expelled from the national furrier union owned by the AFL for their communist ideals. In the union, Samuel climbed up the ranks to become the chairman, serving in this position for 2 years. His responsibilities included organization and education, including teaching members subjects like culture and drama. In addition, he was a member of a Jewish sports club called Maccabbees from 1922 to 1930, becoming an organizer of the club for 4 years of that period. In 1933, Samuel joined the Communist Party of New York. He would become a distributor of propaganda in the party and participate in demonstrations until he was arrested, landing him in jail from 1934 to 1935. Many of Samuels&rsquo; arrests throughout his life were due to his party affiliation. He became a member of the International Fur Workers Union when it merged with the union in New York and appointed Ben Gold as their president in 1935. During the time Samuel lived in NYC, he either lived in an apartment in Harlem (515 West 124th Street) or one in Chelsea (250 West 26th Street).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn January 6, 1937, he went aboard the SS Paris and sailed for Spain, where he arrived on January 25. The journey was arranged by the Communist Party, and his motivation for coming to Spain was to fight against the fascists. Samuel served with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, a part of Section 2 Group 3 of Company 2&rsquo;s second roster, and fought in the Battle of Jarama. He was lucky enough to not become part of the 120 dead or 175 wounded from the Abraham Lincoln Brigade during that battle, where the brigade advanced onto Nationalist forces without support only to be gunned down. Due to his conduct in Jarama, he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in May. He fought in the Battle of Brunete in July 1937, transferring out temporarily due to a fracture in his arm and leg. Many of his comrades suffered similar or worse fates during the battle, especially during the infamous assaults by the brigade on Mosquito Ridge. Samuel was discharged from Murcia hospital due to incompetence and insubordination in January 1938. Unaffected by this, he came back to the Brigade, continuing to fight in Aragon and the Ebro offensive. Samuel returned to the US on August 28, 1938, less than a month before the Spanish prime minister disbanded all international brigades fighting in Spain. Afterwards, he enlisted in the US Army in 1943 and served there in 1945. Samuel died in 1989 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Harry Perlman was born on August 11, 1908, in New York city. The son of Jewish immigrants, Yetta and Joseph Perelman (which would later be shortened to Perlman), from Russia. A native New Yorker, Perlman was raised in the Bronx, and stayed in the city as an office worker as grew up. In 1932, radicalized by the ongoing Great Depression, Perlman joined the Communist Party. In 1935, Perlman married Celia Dembrofsky.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Communist Party of 1930s New York was a powerful force. In part, this was a result of its large immigrant population (four-fifths of the Communists in New York were foreign born), though like Perlman, many native-born children of immigrants also joined the party. From the 1930s to 1950s, NYC would remain the capital of communism in America, where the ideology thrived more than anywhere else. By 1938, New York State comprised about half of the Communist Party&rsquo;s national membership.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThroughout the 1930s and 1940s, open Communists even held several seats of the New York City Council, and won hundreds of thousands of votes for the presidency of the board of aldermen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Great Depression &ndash; which lasted from 1929 until the outbreak of World War II in 1941 &ndash; helped radicalize many to socialist politics. The &ldquo;workers&rsquo; state&rdquo; of the Soviet Union appeared to be thriving at a time when the capitalist world seemed to falter. To many who suffered immensely at the time, Communism seemed as though it held the answers to their plight.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1937, following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Perlman joined many other communists in New York in traveling to Spain, to join the &ldquo;good fight.&rdquo; Departing on May 8, 1937, aboard the American Importer, he arrived in Spain on June 1 of the same year, via the town of Llansa on the coast. Once in Spain, as part of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, Perlman fought primarily in Belchite.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBelchite was a town in Aragon on the frontlines where, in mid-1937, the Republican forces launched an offensive attempting to capture the Nationalist town of Zaragoza - the capital of Aragon. While the Republicans managed to find minor success, their gains were limited at best, and soon the advance came to a standstill. The brutal fighting led to the utter destruction of Belchite. As Cecil D. Eby put it, &ldquo;Belchite was less a town than a nasty smell&rdquo; following the fighting in the town. This destruction is even preserved to the modern day, as Franco did not allow the town to be rebuilt, becoming a monument to the brutality of the nationalists, and a warning to those who opposed them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the early spring of 1938, the Rebels began a counteroffensive in Aragon. As the Nationalists managed to break through the Republican lines in multiple places, the XV Battalion (the unit which contained the Abraham Lincoln Brigade) was forced into a brutal fighting retreat to avoid encirclement. When the battalion ended its retreat with the crossing of the Ebro River later that spring, it was a shadow of its former self. Perlman was far from alone among his comrades in death during this spring. Indeed, the British brigade would escape the spring with only 80 soldiers remaining, and 42 fit for service. The Abraham Lincoln Brigade, though it suffered less, was hardly in better shape.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUltimately, Harry Perlman gave his life away for a cause he believed in. It was thanks to him, and his fellow comrades who fell during those retreats, that the Lincoln Brigade, and the whole of the XV Battalion, was able to avoid total destruction at the hands of the nationalists. His actions saved lives and, for a short period until the end of the war in 1939, kept the hope alive that a republican Spain might triumph. It is for that, which he should be remembered.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Jacob (Jack) Shulman was born on July 29, 1914, as the fifth of seven children of Jewish refugees who fled Czarist Russia. Both of his parents arrived in Canada en route to the United States in 1902, where they met each other and eventually moved to Rochester, New York. His father worked as a house painter, and his mother as a washerwoman. From these humble beginnings, Shulman managed to win a scholarship to Cornell University, where he took part in the Reserve Officers&rsquo; Training Corps. However, he was forced to drop out as a result of the economic ramifications of the Great Depression. Despite having come from a rather conservative family, the three years he spent at Cornell exposed him to leftist thinking, and Shulman then became engaged in politics, joining the Young Communist League in 1930.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In February of 1937, at the tender age of 23, he organized a group of 18 fellow communists and took a ship to France, intending to cross into Spain and join the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. He chose to fight because he was unemployed at the time, and held the strong conviction that the emergence of fascism would spark another world war. Organized in groups of 6 or 7 people, they posed as students and tourists and reached France by March. However, due to a breakdown in the Spanish railroad system, he spent about 2 weeks sheltered in the attic of a school building in the town of Sete in southern France. Eventually, several taxi cabs arrived, which Shulman and his comrades were marshaled into and hurriedly driven to the Pyrenees overnight by a group of professional Andorran smugglers. He crossed over in Catalonia, and was picked up by trucks from the small nearby town of Figueras.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once in Spain, he held an edge over his peers in regards to experience, as he had been previously familiar with military chains of command, points of discipline, instruction, and organization, whereas the others had no military training whatsoever. Shulman was assigned to the artillery corps of the George Washington Battalion, stationed just outside of Madrid, and due to his ROTC experience and basic knowledge of artillery, he was considered a seasoned miltiaryman and immediately promoted to sergeant. Ironically enough, his artillery unit of 15-20 people was not in possession of any artillery, and was not even big enough to be considered a unit. Because Italian fascists had torpedoed Russian ships smuggling 76 millimeter artillery guns via the Black Sea, the Republicans were forced to resort to using &ldquo;very old, obsolete, ancient&rdquo; cannons left over from the 1890s, although Shulman remarks that they appeared almost as if they were holdovers from the Napoleonic Wars. The guns had large wooden wheels that were about six feet high, and shot seven to eight inch shells. With no horses or pack animals, the ammunition and weapons had to be transported and handled using sheer manpower. The operation of these weapons was also quite dangerous: the Republicans were often less concerned with the fascists than they were with the artillery backfiring or exploding in their faces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, Shulman was in Spain for about 2 years and 2 months, during which he battled both malaria and the elements. By fall of 1938, he was officially withdrawn from his position, retreating to Albacete. He was meant to be evacuated through Valencia, but the boats never arrived, and the city was soon cut off by the fascists. Eventually, he managed to make his way out to Barcelona with his unit via an old coal freighter, in suffocatingly dusty conditions. During the siege of Barcelona, Shulman bravely volunteered to go out to try to defend the city, despite hardly anyone previously making it out alive. As the volunteer group was only 7 men strong, they were refused by the military leaders. One of these seven was in fact a man named Vincent Lossowski, the son of working-class Polish immigrants who had previously known Shulman in Rochester, and had only reunited with him as they were leaving Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By January 25, 1939, seeing as the situation was hopeless, the surviving volunteers were sent on a rickety train back to the French border, and just in time, as Barcelona soon fell. Both individuals distinctly recall a ragged old woman begging for food by the side of the train tracks, who they felt perfectly represented the situation that they had left behind. Shulman recalls the bitterness and utter helplessness he experienced at the time: &ldquo;We were very much disappointed in the democratic countries for not helping the Spanish Republic,&rdquo; he reflects, &ldquo;We were fighting to prevent World War II. What we did there was a failed effort, but it was an effort that had to be made. By fighting fascism in Spain, we delayed the start of World War II by three years.&rdquo; However, he also acknowledges that the volunteers knew very well that it wasn&rsquo;t the end of the matter - rather, they &ldquo;knew it was just the beginning.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shulman and the remaining volunteers were escorted onto a large ocean liner under a military escort in the port town of Le Havre. Unfortunately, many Spanish Republicans, civilians, and refugees who also crossed over from the Pyrenees were placed into internment camps by the French, where they were kept for 3 to 5 years, but the Americans avoided this fate, as they were foreigners. The volunteers eventually arrived in New York City, met by a celebratory, excited crowd. However, the US government was not as thrilled in regards to the matter. &ldquo;Guys from the FBI kept coming around,&rdquo; he revealed in an interview, &ldquo;They terrified my mother and father, asking about me and Spain.&rdquo; They had confiscated and burned a suitcase full of letters, souvenirs, and memorabilia from Spain that he kept at his parents&rsquo; Rochester home, and continued to harass him up to his enlistment in the Second World War.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shulman made it back to Rochester with Lossowski by February 7, 1939, and was shocked to be greeted by about 400 people at the city&rsquo;s New York Central train station. Despite having left Rochester covertly, when he came back, &ldquo;it seemed like everyone knew it.&rdquo; Once he got back home, he was greeted by his worrysick mother, who remarked &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your arms, you&rsquo;ve got your legs - what more could I ask?&rdquo; as she embraced him.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon settling back down, he became a full-time member of the CPUSA. He worked closely with prominent communist leader William Z. Foster as his secretary, and was sent on numerous outreach missions to survey the extent of the spread of &lsquo;Browderism,&rsquo; the following of Earl Browder, a former leader of the CPUSA who was widely considered to be a &lsquo;revisionist,&rsquo; and unfaithful to Marxist-Leninist ideals. Shulman also volunteered for the U.S. Army in 1944. Although he was considered old, his prior military experience made him a prime candidate for officerial training, and upon informing army officials that he had been in an artillery corps in Spain, they were also &ldquo;awfully eager&rdquo; to send him to field artillery schools in order to teach newcomers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later on in life in 1959 and 1960, he also travelled to Cuba, serving as Foster&rsquo;s eyes and ears, and then went to Albania after Foster died on September 1, 1961, while in the Soviet Union. At this point, Shulman was heavily criticized and ostracized by other members of the party, and gradually distanced himself from its leaders. In 1968, he went on to visit China during the &ldquo;Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution&rdquo; &mdash; Mao Zedong&rsquo;s purge that lasted from 1966 to 1976. There, he served as an English editor for the Peking Press, but, eventually coming to believe that China was turning revisionist, he returned to Albania, where he started the USA-Albania Friendship Association and published the Albania Report, as well as publicizing and distributing Albanian literature in America and other nations. After the fall of communism in 1989, he supported the International Struggle Marxist-Leninist (ISML), and was also a source of great assistance and encouragement to Indian Marxist-Leninists. Shulman passed away on October 19, 1999, in Brooklyn, although by 2008, his American associates had formed the anti-revisionist, Hoxhaist party, the American Party of Labor. One such associate, a writer for the Red Phoenix, Alfonso Casal, aptly remarks: &ldquo;Jack was an amazing man, a true comrade, and a dear friend.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Ruth Wilson Epstein was born on November 2nd, 1906 in Brooklyn, NY. Little else is known about her early life. She received a higher education at a university in New York, taking elemental political courses during her time there. Ruth Beverly Wilson married an office worker named Jacob Epstein in 1934 and took his last name. Now under the name of Ruth Wilson Epstein, she and her husband joined the Communist Party USA in 1934.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRuth decided to serve as a nurse in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade as a part of her dedication to improving the lives of the poor and oppressed. On May 17th, 1937, Ruth received passport #414737 in preparation for her travels. At the time, her address was listed as 319 E. 17th Street, New York. Ruth sailed for Spain with the 6th American Medical Group, arriving in Spain on May 29th, 1937. Upon arrival, she also joined the Communist Party Spain. Ruth began her war service as a nurse in Murcia at the International Brigade hospitals based there. While there, she was pivotal in establishing proper nursing care and educated fellow nurses to meet the Republic&rsquo;s shortage of trained hospital nurses. Furthermore, on January 10th, 1938, Epstein spoke on Radio Madrid&rsquo;s broadcast to the US describing the challenges posed by the nursing shortage in Spain and how she provided a rudimentary nursing education to local Spanish women in the region&#39;s &ldquo;first nursing school.&rdquo; After the fascists overran Murcia, Epstein and her fellow nurses were relocated to a larger hospital, Mataro, in Catalonia. Here, she was reunited with Jacob for he had arrived in Spain in 1938 also as a Lincoln Brigade volunteer, serving as a liaison between the US brigade-patients and the Republican military command. Epstein continued to take care of injured patients until Catalonia was overrun at the war&rsquo;s end. The Epsteins returned to the US on December 31st, 1938 aboard President Harding.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThough unclear as to how, Ruth and her husband soon became involved with the People&rsquo;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), the precursor to the Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti (KGB). The US Army&rsquo;s Signal Intelligence Service, the precursor to the National Security Agency (NSA) revealed the Epsteins affairs through VENONA (started February 1943) where they decoded KGB encryption of Society transactions. NKVD communication between Mexico City and Moscow revealed on March 25th, 1944 that the NKVD were planning on having Jacob return to America as soon as the Gnome affair was complete. At this time, the Americans were already surveilling Jacob in Mexico and Ruth in New York City, with a possible arrest impending. The Gnome affair was decoded to be about the breaking out of Jacques Mornard, most commonly known as Ram&oacute;n Mercader and Leon Trotsky&rsquo;s murderer, from the Mexican prisons. On April 16th, 1944, it was communicated that Juan Gaytan Godoy was endlessly delaying Jacob&rsquo;s departure for America and in turn the departure of Pavel P. Klarin, the 2nd Secretary at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. Jacob&rsquo;s departure was complicated by the fact that he did not want to leave Mexico. On April 21st, 1944, Lt. Gen. P.M. Fitin was notified that Jacob&rsquo;s departure was dependent on Juan Gayton Godoy, to which he responded on April 27th that Jacob was to be handed over to &ldquo;Kira&rdquo; for liaison. By August 1944, Jacob had been sent home to the US and was suspected by the NKVD of having indiscreetly revealed information on the Gnome Affair. On March 21st, 1945, Moscow had contacted New York asking for a password and details about rendezvousing with &ldquo;Nona.&rdquo; In this transaction, the Soviets revealed the true identities of &ldquo;Harry&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nona&rdquo; to be Jacob Epstein and Ruth Wilson, respectively. This was critical as the communication helped the SIS identify Soviet agents. During a hearing on the Trotsky assassination, the House Committee on Un-American Activities questioned Jacob on Communist Party membership to which he pleaded the Fifth. He remained vague in all his responses to questions ranging from signing his own passport applications to meeting with Pavel Klarin or Anna Colloms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaving not been indicted, Ruth and Jacob were left to live a life enriched by a wide range of cultural interests and a warm circle of friends and family in New York City as a closely knit couple and veterans of the Spanish Civil War. For several decades before their retirement, the Epsteins were teamed as highly successful designers and builders of custom office furniture. At age 90, Ruth Wilson Epstein passed away in New York City on December 12th, 1996. She was survived by Jacob, to whom she was married to for 62 years.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Jacob Louis Teiger, who also went by Jack, Jake, Jakob, etc., was born on February 6. 1914 in Brooklyn, New York to Samuel Teiger and Sylvia Teiger. Teiger, who was of Jewish descent, only received a year of a high school education, becoming a dental technician and a hatter afterward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On April 23, 1937, he received his passport, and on May 8th of that year, Jacob Teiger was onboard the American Importer as a volunteer in the Spanish Civil War. He arrived in Spain after crossing the Pyrenes Mountains through what is called the Massanet route. He served as a part of the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, the XV International Brigade (in which the Lincoln Battalion was a part of), the Lincoln-Washington Battalion, and the Lincoln Battalion Co.2, serving in the Lincoln Battalion and the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion from August 1937 to December 1938.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his time as a volunteer, he was shot in the left leg and received shrapnel in his right. Although he recovered, the damp weather did not favor him, frequently bothering him and eventually permanently disqualified him from service when he served in World War II. He was also admitted into the Farners de la Selva Hospital on September 14. 1938 for a wounded hand, which caused him to miss the parade in Barcelona.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teiger was involved in the Battle of Ebro, where he was dive-bombed and was torpedoed. Teiger remembers being with a Lopez from San Francisco at the time and credits them both in straightening the rest of the group out after the torpedo had killed eight and injured 10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teiger&rsquo;s comrades seemed to have varying opinions of Teiger. Some claimed that he got along well with his fellow volunteers. Others said that he was vicious and slanderous towards his uppers. The latter at the least seems likely as Teiger, who was adamant in his political beliefs and was willing to get into arguments about his beliefs. Teiger was a Communist, a member of the Communist Party and the Young Communist League, and heavily disliked liberals and Trotskyites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He returned back to the United States on September 24, 1942 onboard the Ausonia, after which he enlisted in World War II and worked as a guard and, much to his chagrin, a truck driver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps due to communist affiliations, Teiger was put on the list of hearings by the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws on the Judiciary United States Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He married &ldquo;Sara&rdquo; Savilla Cogswell in 1945 and died on August 23, 1976, in Baltimore. Cogswell, however, attended Abraham Lincoln Brigade reunions after Teiger&#39;s death with her husband and stepson.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Samuel &ldquo;Steven&rdquo; Daduk was a Jewish-American who volunteered to defend the Spanish Republic when nationalist troops launched their coup d&rsquo;etat in 1936. Steven Daduk was born on March 10, 1912, in Brooklyn, New York. His passport listed his address as 2357 64th Street, Brooklyn. During this time, this neighborhood, Bensonhurst, was very ethnically Jewish. Daduk being Jewish (according to information provided by the University of Barcelona) was a factor that may have contributed to his compulsion to go and aid the Republic very early following the start of the rebellion as Italy and Germany began supporting the military uprising. Daduk supposedly went to the College of the City of New York (though questionable as this information comes from The Michigan Daily, the University of Michigan&rsquo;s school newspaper). The College of the City of New York, also known as the &ldquo;Harvard for the Proletariat,&rdquo; was a politically radical place during the 1930s when Daduk likely attended. This intellectual hotspot teemed with discussions on communism; people who supported either Stalin or Trotsky met at this renowned university to debate the correct implementation of communism. Daduk eventually joined the CPUSA (Communist Party of the United States of America) in 1934, another factor that may have encouraged Daduk&rsquo;s quest to Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore going to Spain, Daduk worked as an engineer and electrician. Additionally, he had two years of prior military experience under his belt. This repertoire of skills and experience made him appear to be a valuable asset to the loyalists.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDaduk received passport #346856 on October 2, 1936. Just eight days later, on October 10, 1936, Daduk would arrive at his destination. He was one of the first American volunteers in Spain. While there, Daduk would fight as a pilot and then as an infantryman. Initially, Daduk flew for the Spanish Republic&rsquo;s air force in the air battles over Madrid but was wounded in action, injuring his thigh and getting a broken hip. Daduk shot down a German Heinkel 111, something which he bragged a lot about while in Spain. However, because his stories were not confirmed, his companions questioned the authenticity of his stories &mdash; especially as it appeared that his narrative changed every time he retold the story. This would not help him later as his compatriots ended up believing that all his stories and feats were fiction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a result of getting wounded in action after being shot down, Daduk was moved to join the rest of the Americans. Daduk fought with the Fifteenth International Brigade, the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, which was filled with other North Americans interested in defending the Republic. When Robert Hale Merriman, a well-educated American, was promoted from adjutant to commander of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, Daduk was promoted to captain-adjutant Second Company. Daduk eventually spread rumors about Merriman being a Russian plant in an attempt to avoid the front lines. Daduk felt that the International Brigades were going to be sent to the slaughter after he realized the intended purpose of the International Brigades. Furthermore, though the earlier rumors of his feats as a pilot being false did not appear to affect him immediately, the effects of this eroding damage to his reputation came back to haunt him. When Daduk&rsquo;s accusations were shown to be false, his reputation in the Brigade was killed. It was this string of actions and circumstances that led Daduk&rsquo;s peers in the brigade to turn on him. Consequently, in late January, just before the Battle of Jarama, Daduk was removed from his leadership position &mdash; replaced by Eugene Morse as the commander of Second Company. During training, when it appeared that Daduk was not as fit for combat as he made himself out to be, Merriman began having concerns about Daduk. On February 19th, 1937, Merriman&rsquo;s diary says that Daduk &ldquo;cracked up&rdquo; and was promptly removed from the front. This occurred during the bloody Battle of Jarama, a battle that brought the Abraham Lincoln Brigade many casualties as they had been used as shock troops. After being wounded again and getting hospitalized in Albacete, Daduk was promptly repatriated to the United States at the end of May, returning to the states on July 2, 1937, aboard the Chaplain under the name of Samuel Daduk. Steven Daduk had spent less than a year in Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDaduk still supported the cause and the organization even after his return. Despite being described by Merriman as a &ldquo;weak&rdquo; speaker, back at home Daduk promoted the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in a coast-to-coast fund drive along with other members of the International Brigades like Humberto Galleani, a member of the Twelfth International Brigade. Despite Daduk&rsquo;s efforts to raise funds, the Republican force and International Brigades&rsquo; weaponry still lagged behind the rebel force&rsquo;s German and Italian support. However, by demonstrating his support for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, Daduk wound up getting investigated for participating in &ldquo;un-American&rdquo; propaganda activities while he tried fundraising for the Spanish Republic and the FALB (Friends of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade). This was due in part to the fact that the Republic was a Popular Front government, that the Abraham Lincoln Brigade was heavily influenced by the CPUSA and that Daduk himself was a member of this &ldquo;un-American&rdquo; party, as were many other &ldquo;Lincolns.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the Spanish Civil War, Steven Daduk reportedly fought in the World War II Medical Corps. This is interesting as he chose not to fight in World War II as either a pilot or an infantryman, both of which he would have had experience with from Spain. This may have been a result of the United States government restricting a former &ldquo;Lincoln&rdquo; from fighting in the war with an actual weapon because these former members of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade were considered to be security risks. After his return from World War II, Steven Daduk stayed in Brooklyn but kept a low profile, likely to avoid further scrutiny from the FBI and risk being seen as a communist threat. Steven Daduk later died in Brooklyn on Wednesday, October 10, 1986, fifty years after he first set foot in Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nP.S. As a result of the limited amount of time that Daduk spent in Spain (especially as he was there extremely early in the war, staying less than a year) there is a lack of photographic evidence to show Steven Daduk&rsquo;s existence in Spain. Furthermore, the small and under strength Second Company of the Lincoln Brigade received less attention and resources than the First Company. Additionally, among the other foreign pilots who flew for the Republic, Daduk was unfortunately the only one without an image. It is also possible that Daduk was very camera shy following his return from the Second World War and the start of the Cold War.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Barnett Steve Kutler, more commonly known as Benjamin (&ldquo;Ben&rdquo;) Kotler, was born on June 12, 1915 in Brooklyn, New York. He was Jewish, and was a member of the Communist Party. Not much is known of his life in New York City prior to joining the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, but it is known that he lived at 210 Madison St in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn (his family likely having moved there after the opening of the elevated railway and the Brooklyn bridge in 1883 and 1885 respectively), and that he had a brother named Louis Kotler. He was studious, having graduated from Brooklyn College with an unknown degree summa cum laude, and he worked as a teacher after that. In March of 1938, only two months before his arrival in Spain, Kotler became a member of the Communist Party.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter signing to serve for the brigade, Kotler arrived in Spain on May 15, 1938 via the Massanet, and started serving as a soldier in the third company, the Machine Gun Company, in June. This company, unlike the two infantry companies, held an unknown number of people, but there were an approximate 75 people in similar formations, so it can be estimated that there were a similar number of soldiers here. Sections of this company were almost always at full strength due to the stronger weapons they had such as larger machine guns, unlike those of the other two, which mainly equipped their soldiers with rifles. Members of this company at this time, likely including Kotler, served mostly in the Battle of the Ebro, the longest and bloodiest battle in the Spanish Civil War, around the Ebro River. He would have been part of the large offensive fighting against Republican troops, with initial success that eventually was undone by a successful counterattack from Franco. In September of that same year, Franco managed to capture several members of the Third Company in the town of Corbera, and this was around the time that Kotler ended his service in the company. He then served at the Plaza Mayor, at the time known as the Plaza de la Rep&uacute;blica (of the Republic, referring to the first Republic), a major historical landmark constantly renamed for different reigns. It&rsquo;s unlikely that any battle happened here; Kotler likely aided in non-bloody areas of the Republican cause such as unloading materials. In December of 1938, he returned to New York on the R.M.S Ausonia, which brought about 50 total veterans from the war.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUpon returning to New York City, Kotler married his wife, Ida, and had a daughter, Judith. He lived on 78 Manhattan Avenue in Manhattan Valley. On September 13, 1943, he enlisted in the New York Guard, and after two years he reenlisted on September 24, 1945 to serve two more years. However, based on the blank separation date after Kotler&rsquo;s second term, he did not fulfill the full two years of service. Shortly before the time that the two years would have been completed, in 1946, the state guard saw a reorganization of the National Guard involving the National Guard units taking New York Guard units. During this transition, Kotler likely became a member of the State War Disaster Military Corp, which aimed to aid the National Guard, but was shortly deactivated. In late 1946, the New York Guard slowly phased out of existence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, a few years after his time serving for the New York Guard, Kotler joined the United Electrical Workers Union (UE). He joined the union in 1951, only two years after the withdrawal of the UE from the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in 1949, which corresponded with the painting of the UE by the media as &ldquo;communist-dominated&rdquo;. In the early 1950s, exactly when he joined, the large presence of anti-communist agenda caused the union to be branded as a &ldquo;subversive organization&rdquo; and for the leader of the union to be deported, and it lost over half of its members. The fact that Kotler joined in the midst of such chaos in the union proves his dedication to the Communist Party.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter this incident, the union rose up once again with reorganization in the 1960s to 1970s. However, in the early 1980s, many plants were closed by corporate giants in hopes of profiting from exploitation of others abroad. The UE led resistance movements against these closings, but still, many members, including Kotler, were forced out of the union due to layoffs. Working here from 1951 to 1984, Kotler spent thirty-three years of his life at the union.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTen years after leaving the union, Kotler passed away in New York, New York on December 25, 1994. He was buried in the Mount Ararat Cemetery in Suffolk County.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Bertha F. Kipness was born in Nerashka, Russia on November 4, 1900. In 1909, her family immigrated to the United States on the ship New Amsterdam through Ellis Island in New York City. They settled in the Elmwood Park neighborhood of Philadelphia, a neighborhood made up of mainly Russian and some German immigrants. She lived with her widowed mother, Fannie, her older brother, George, and her younger sister, Anna, and spoke Yiddish growing up. Her father, Jacob, immigrated through Ellis Island in 1906, three years before the rest of the family, but died shortly after the family arrived in the United States. When the Communist Party of the United States was founded in 1919, Kipness joined soon after. Her membership in the Communist Party would later be an inspiration for her decision to join the fight in Spain later on, like many others. On May 14, 1926, Kipness became a naturalized citizen of the United States.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a teenager and in her early 20s, she worked as a typist for a chemical sales company before graduating from the Mt. Sinai Training School for Nurses in 1926. Founded in Philadelphia by the Beth Israel Hospital Association and the Mt. Sinai Hospital Association, the Mt. Sinai Hospital of Philadelphia was created to aid the poor, Jewish, immigrant population in Philadelphia in tandem with other medical aid centers in the area, like the Jewish Hospital, which also served the local population. After graduating from nursing school, she began working in a covalent home in the Krewstown neighborhood of Philadelphia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter working as a nurse in Philadelphia during the &lsquo;20s and early &lsquo;30s, Kipness moved to Brooklyn, New York. Still, her Philadelphia roots stayed with her&mdash; she remained a member of the Communist Party of Eastern Philadelphia. Her move to Brooklyn was likely prompted by her brother, George, who lived in Brooklyn with his wife, Edith, and their daughter, Ethel. The family lived on Reid Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant, which was, at the time, a neighborhood made up mostly of the children of European immigrants moving out of the Lower East Side and into Brooklyn. Like her hometown of Philadelphia, her neighborhood in New York was made up mostly of people of Jewish and Eastern European descent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter living in Brooklyn for only a short period of time, Kipness arrived in Spain on April 8, 1937, where she served as a nurse for the Republican Medical Services with the American Medical Bureau. Kipness was stationed at a hospital in southern Spain, likely in Murcia. As a part of the International Brigade, all nurses received some training from the Red Cross, but the level of training varied based on experience. The training courses required for nurses varied in length from about one week to two months, so, as a trained nurse, Kipness likely would have received little training upon her arrival. After her training period, she served as a nurse with the George Washington Second American Battalion, which fought alongside the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and was headed by Mirko Markovics, a former commissar of the Red Army.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a 1938 pamphlet titled &ldquo;From the Cradle of Liberty&hellip; To the Tomb of Facism,&rdquo; sent from Spain to Philadelphia, Kipness and others contributed letters and writings to bolster support for the Republican cause. In a letter addressed to her mother on May 26, 1937, Kipness writes of the good conditions at her hospital, talking of leisurely activities and plentiful food and water. While she writes of good spirits among the Republicans, she also makes a comment on Spanish society, saying that &ldquo;the conditions here are similar to the conditions during the Czarist days of Russia,&#39;&#39; regarding the lack of education that the water boy at her hospital received. She also says that his position was not uncommon, citing that 65% of the people in Spain received no schooling and had worked since childhood. Her distaste for pre-Communist Russia, as well as, of course, her involvement in the Communist Party, heavily inspired her support for the Republic, playing into her decision to travel to Spain and fight against the ultimate enemy: fascism.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the end of her letter, Kipness writes that the spirits amongst the Republicans and the Republican army were high, and also reports that the motivation of the army came from a place of true dedication to the cause, saying &ldquo;they definitely know why they are fighting and they surely will win.&rdquo; Her impression of the Republican army was shared by the other writers in the pamphlet, who wrote from both the fields and the frontline in Madrid saying that morale was high and that they believed that the Republic would pull through. One soldier, Andrew Pape, even wrote that &ldquo;our doctors and nurses here are the world&rsquo;s best&mdash; they certainly perform miracles with boys you&rsquo;d never expect to pull through.&rdquo; Overall, the effectiveness of volunteer doctors and nurses in Spain was a collective effort, facilitated by their high morale. Nurses and doctors write of hard work, constantly going from one surgery to the next &ndash; sometimes for days without stopping &ndash; to treat severely injured soldiers. Despite the difficulty of the work, the nurses in Spain, according to a head nurse, Fredericka Martin, &ldquo;have never lost their cheerful spirit or quarreled with each other or grumbled&rdquo; and were eager to provide the best care they possibly could.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter serving in Spain for just over a year, Kipness left Europe from Le Havre, France aboard the Ile de France on August 13, 1938 and arrived in New York six days later. Instead of listing her address in the United States as being in Brooklyn, though, she listed her address in Philadelphia. When she arrived in New York, she moved back to Pennsylvania to live with her mother and sister, and continued her work as a nurse for a private practice. In 1944, she remarried Charles Cohen, who she had married and divorced prior to her time in Spain, in Philadelphia. After five years of marriage, Kipness died on June 19, 1949 at 49 years old. She is buried at the Mount Jacob Cemetery in Glenolden, Pennsylvania.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Max Kirschbaum was born on March 9, 1910, in Ohio. His parents were Henry and Sophie Kirschbaum, a worker and professional dress designer with ties to the Communist Party and anarchism, respectively. He was a member of the Jewish faith, being able to speak Jewish-English. He grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio, attending the general education program until high school. At the age of 14, he was first exposed to communism through the Pioneer movement by his father, who was a trade union member. Five years later, he became part of the Young Communist League (YCL).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKirschbaum took part in the Works Progress Administration (WPA), the New Deal agency established to create jobs, particularly in constructing public roads and spaces. This allowed him to move to New York City, where he lived with his family at 2070 Vyre Avenue in the Bronx. As part of the WPA, Kirschbaum joined the WPA trade union and was employed in a 50-member company within the dress manufacturing industry, with an average salary of around $20 (around $450 in today&rsquo;s money). In 1935, Kirschbaum registered with the Communist Party in Brooklyn, which was led at the time by the influential organizer Carl Vedro, joining the 5th Branch of the 17th Section in District 2 of the party. He would serve as the organizer of that branch from June 1935 to June 1937. From 1935 to 1936, Kirschbaum also attended the New York Workers&rsquo; School, which was created by the Communist Party of the USA (CPUSA) in 1923 to educate supporters on Marxism and the communist movement in America. Additionally, from 1934 to 1936, Kirschbaum was involved with the International Labor Defense, the US branch of the Socorro Rojo (&ldquo;Red Relief&rdquo;), a social service organization organized by Communist International and which had headquarters in NYC. Kirscbaum also had a criminal history, largely tied to his political activism. He was arrested twice and tried for criminal syndicalism, going in front of magistrates in Cincinnati and New York. He spent 5 days in the Brooklyn County Jail in August 1934. Kirschbaum has also been detained three times and processed five times in April-June of 1930 and June-July of 1934.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile Kirschbaum was a member of the Communist Party since January 1935, he also became involved with the Workers Alliance of America (WAA) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). The CIO was founded on November 9, 1935, to promote industrial unionism, which emphasized unionization along industry lines as opposed to based on individual crafts and skills. This would have appealed to Kirschbaum as he worked in automotive factories when employed with Chrysler around this time, making him the target group for the CIO. More importantly, however, the WAA was initially founded by the Socialist Party in early March 1935 amidst a period of turmoil amongst the political far-left. However, the communists&rsquo; Communist Party USA (CPUSA) soon merged into the WAA in 1936 after a full year of negotiations, making it an umbrella organization for workers associated with the far-left. Interestingly, the WAA soon became associated with the administration, as around 75% of its members were WPA, including Kirschbaum. It is most likely that Kirschbaum gained access to his tickets to Spain through the CPUSA&mdash;the central provider for passes and other essentials to journey to Spain&mdash;via the WAA.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen he was 28, Kirschbaum departed the United States on May 8, 1937, aboard the American Importer and arrived in Barcelona, Spain on May 30. He was part of the Lincoln-Washington Battalion of the XV International Brigade (more commonly known as the Abraham Lincoln Brigade). Kirschbaum was specifically part of the 58th Battalion, 1st Company. Upon arrival, he had to march through the Pyrenees to join the rest of the brigade, where he was assigned to the brigade&rsquo;s Auto Park in Albacete until July 1937, being given the job of a driver. From July to September of 1937, he served as an ambulance driver for the first group during the Sanidad Evacuation. His last assignment was as a chauffeur for front-line hospitals from October 1937 to August of 1938. Kirschbaum held the rank of a soldier for his whole time in Spain, but was nominated for the rank of Lieutenant in February 1938. As part of the Lincoln-Washington Battalion, Kirschbaum took part in and survived the battles at Brunette (referred to as the Center Front), Aragon &amp; Huesca, Extremadura, Teruel, and the Ebro Valley. He served as an ambulance driver for all the battles except for the Ebro Offensive, where he was a soldier. Kirschbaum&rsquo;s last battle in the Spanish Civil War was during the Ebro Offensive in August 1938. It was at this battle, in the Sierra Pandols, that Kirschbaum was injured, being hit by a trench mortar on August 17, 1938. He suffered injuries to his left leg, chest, shoulders, neck and head, and stayed at the Preventorium of La Sabinosa (in Tarragona, near Barcelona) for 10 days. By October 1938, the International Brigades had been disbanded, and he soon returned to New York City on December 20, 1938 aboard the ship Ausonia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn October of 1943, Kirschbaum enlisted to join the US Army during World War II. He first arrived at Camp Upton in Yaphank, Long Island, New York for processing. However, as a self-proclaimed veteran of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, Kirschbaum had put himself subject to Counterintelligence Operations and their quest &ldquo;to acquire an intimate knowledge of the following &lsquo;subversive or potentially subversive groups:&rsquo; &hellip; 2. Communist.&rdquo; Over the course of a month, he was questioned about his history of fighting in Spain, writing in a letter that this investigation was likely due to him being an &ldquo;accused&rdquo; communist. That same letter was part of a Communist Party campaign organized by Abraham Lincoln Brigade veterans to stand against such counterintelligence procedures. Kirschbaum was then transferred to Camp Blanding around November-December of 1943 to join the Army Infantry. Here, Kirschbaum was told that he should refrain from political conversations due to the ongoing investigation into his political beliefs. He was questioned again by a Counter Espionage unit from G-2 (military intelligence) at Camp McCain one month later, right after reuniting with his unit. The questions covered his entire past, from his criminal history in the 1930s to his involvement with the CPUSA, WPA, WAA, and CIO. This repetitive and intrusive questioning ticked off Kirschbaum, who believed his political beliefs and voting record were private, and that he wants these investigations to come to an end. In his frustration, he wrote asks to once-and-for-all be considered either a criminal or an American soldier. Then, just four weeks later, and two weeks after receiving a promotion to become the Company Mail Clerk, Kirschbaum was notified that he had been found to be a communist and could not continue in his job.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMax Kirschbaum eventually moved to Rockledge, Florida in 1980, where he lived until his death on March 30, 1994.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>George Sidney Hendrickson was born on December 21st, 1906. He was born to father George Hendrickson and mother Mary Carberry. His father worked many trades, from carpenter, to motorman, to hospital attendant. His mother was initially a saleswoman, but later became a public school teacher. Just as both of his parents had, Hendrickson grew up in Brooklyn, alongside siblings Elizabeth, Albert, Marietta, Margaret, and Monetta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHendrickson never graduated from high school, completing only his first year. After high school he served in the US Army. He also held various other jobs, such as manning train signals, and working as a radio operator. At the time of his volunteering for the war effort, he was single and living in the Bronx, working as a mechanic. Hendrickson became a member of the Communist Party, and the International Workers Order, in 1936. He went over to Spain with the first 96 volunteers aboard the Normandie on December 26, 1936, and arrived in Spain on January 11th, 1937.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn Spain, Hendrickson worked with transmissions, because he had been trained as a radio operator during his time in the Merchant Marines. He then went on to work as a wireless radio operator due to his particular skill. He served in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade until May 1937, &nbsp;but spent the greater part of the war as a radio operator out of Valencia. He&rsquo;s recorded as having worked under volunteer &Oacute;scar Hern&aacute;ndez Rodr&iacute;guez in Valencia. It&rsquo;s also described, in Sidney Kaufman&rsquo;s telling of the war, that he and Kaufman set up a radio while staying at a woman named Maria&rsquo;s house, and listened to broadcasts announcing the arrival of the British consul in Cerbere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn late 1937, the Lincoln Brigade was &nbsp;deployed to defend the walled mountain town of Teruel against the anticipated Nationalist counterattack. That winter, from 1937 to 1938, is noted as having been one of the coldest on record. Many soldiers suffered frostbite. It was in these conditions that Hendrickson found himself working alone, on Christmas, out of an outpost in La Muela, Teruel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nLike many others, Hendrickson lost friends and peers in the war effort. Communication regarding these losses was limited on the warfront. Hendrickson wrote a letter to a fellow &ldquo;comrade,&rdquo; asking them to verify the reported death of Jim Ambers, an American who to his knowledge had never joined the battalion, at his current address in Spain. According to the letter, Hendrickson &ldquo;knew [Ambers] well.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHendrickson returned to the United States on February 9th, 1939, with one of the final groups to leave Spain. He went on to serve during World War II, continuing his work as a radio operator for the Merchant Marines, and joined the Seven Seas Club in 1943, made primarily up of seamen who were also card-carrying Communists. On April 2nd, 1949, Hendrickson married Rosalind (Beatrice) Tvenstup. Rosalind herself had never completed her high school education, due to her family&rsquo;s poverty and her mother&rsquo;s illness, but instead worked many jobs. The Great Depression and Spanish Civil War were also formative for her, and she was a political activist and Communist like her husband.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn 1957, the Department of Defense notified George Hendrickson that his previous military clearance, from his many years of service, had been suspended. The notice listed the various reasons for this suspension, the primary ones being that Hendrickson was or had been a member of the Communist Party, International Workers Order, and served in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil War. The letter explained that all three organizations had been &ldquo;designated by the Attorney General&hellip; as organizations whose interests are in conflict with those of the United States.&rdquo;<br />\r\nGeorge Hendrickson died in Ossipee, New Hampshire, on October 30th, 1976, and was buried in Tewksbury, Massachusetts.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Sana Rose Goldblatt was a Jewish-American born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York on January 8, 1915. Goldblatt grew up on Delancey Street and later moved to Brooklyn with her family. When she was 14 years old, Goldblatt attended rallies at Union Square. Youth, including high school students and young workers, participated in rallies that played an active role in reaching to the general public about the struggles of the American-working class and socialism. When Goldblatt graduated high school in 1931, she found work in the needle trade. Until 1933, Goldblatt worked through the Depression, earning five or six dollars a week to support her family. After saving enough, she began training as a nurse at the Phillip Beth Israel School of Nursing in East Harlem, Manhattan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring her time at Beth Israel, Goldblatt remained vocal and met with nursing students to organize a union. This prevented her from pursuing her dream of studying psychiatric nursing at the renowned Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas. In 1933, the Director of Nursing at Beth Israel refused to recommend Goldblatt for further training due to her political action. Instead, she graduated from Beth Israel and went to train at New York University&rsquo;s Bellevue Hospital in Kips Bay, Manhattan which she also graduated from.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1934, Goldblatt officially joined the Communist Party. In Spring of 1937, at the age of 22, Goldblatt joined the American Medical Bureau (AMB) after viewing an ad in the Daily Worker. The newspapers circulating at the time showed the troubling conditions of civilians and fighters in the Spanish civil war. Furthermore, the ad had an address where volunteers like Goldblatt could go to sign up to participate. The AMB, also known as the American Medical Bureau to Save Spanish Democracy, was a humanitarian aid institution that was operating in Spain as a non-governmental, non-profit organization but was later incorporated into the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Those who applied to work with the AMB received passports, making them legitimate volunteers. Goldblatt&rsquo;s group was the second of the AMB to dispatch. The journey, consisting of Goldblatt and 14 other volunteers, involved taking a boat from New York to France. One train took the group to the border of France and another took them to Spain where they met with Dr. Edward Barsky, coordinator of the first AMB in Spain, at Villa Paz. From there, Goldblatt and the volunteers were sent to wherever help was needed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen she was asked why she joined the war, Goldblatt responded &ldquo;I&rsquo;d seen life by then, I&rsquo;d seen death. They needed medical staff [...] I had a skill that I could contribute to a cause that I believed in. What else can I say?&rdquo; In her 14 months in Spain, Goldblatt served as an operating room nurse in Villa Paz, Alcorisa, and Cordoba. Goldblatt was mostly in Villa Paz, but she was also sent to the battle fronts three or four times. From January to February of 1938, Goldblatt served in Teruel. She became fascinated by French surgical innovations, specifically the autochir (ambulances chirurgicales automobiles). She marveled at the truck for the &ldquo;big operating room table&hellip; for hemostats, for sutures, for bandages, for instruments&hellip;&rdquo; When Goldblatt and her team were in a city close enough to the frontline, they turned a stable into an operating room. Beds and mattresses, IVs, and everything the medical team needed were placed in proximity to wherever the team operated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGoldblatt treated Americans and members of the International Brigades. Serving on the frontlines, rushing from point to point, patient to patient and case to case, she eventually experienced burnout from being around sick patients all the time. She asked Director Barsky to switch her to a different position like laundry, saying that &ldquo;...after a while you feel the whole world is sick. There isn&rsquo;t a human being alive that is well.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen Goldblatt was accompanying a pregnant British nurse leaving Spain, they were stopped by Republican guards at Barcelona. Goldblatt carried sheets of German propaganda for the Daily Worker to use as substance on the ties between Nazi Germany and Franco. In addition they carried a book on the International Brigades, which contained a chapter titled &ldquo;Franco Belge.&rdquo; The women were arrested by the guards for being suspicious and would have been tried and shot if not for the intervention of their male partners. Ernest Hemingway advocated for Goldblatt and the nurse&rsquo;s liberation. Despite tending to the wounded soldiers fighting for the Republic, the nurses would have been tied to the nationalists due to the items they carried and the fact that the guards were barely literate and took Goldblatt&rsquo;s name to be German.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn May 2, 1938, Goldblatt returned to the US aboard the Normandie. Her compassionate nature did not stop after leaving Spain. Her devotion to the cause continued in her participation in The Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade by founding the Bay Area Chapter. Later in WWII, Goldblatt served in a civilian nurse in a US Army hospital.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;I did what I could to create a more equal world.&rdquo; - Sana Rose Goldblatt<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn February 25, 2003 Goldblatt passed away peacefully in her home in San Francisco at the age of 88.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Stephen Zak was born to Thomas and Pauline Zak on September 19, 1916. He went to Technical/Trade School for six years, and, at the age of 16, Stephen joined the Young Communist League in 1932.&nbsp; The Communist League, which was initially founded in 1920, was said to develop its members into Communists, through studying Marxism&ndash;Leninism and through active participation in the struggles of the American working class.&nbsp; Only 5 years later, Stephen joined the Communist Party, in January 1937.&nbsp; The Communist Party, was a political party organized to <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/facilitate\" target=\"_blank\">facilitate</a> the transition of society from <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/capitalism\" target=\"_blank\">capitalism</a> through <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/socialism\" target=\"_blank\">socialism</a> to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/communism\" target=\"_blank\">communism</a>. During this time in the Communist Party, he was a member of the syndicats, but was mostly a part of the militia wing of the organization. He took part in several demonstrations for work and social aid, and strikes for better factory conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He briefly worked in a sugar factory that employed eight hundred people. New York City was once the sugar capital of the world. The ports and piers of New York, specifically those in Brooklyn, made this kingdom of sugar possible. Sugar was big business, and Brooklyn&rsquo;s sugar barons were some of the city&rsquo;s wealthiest men. Raw cane was shipped from tropical countries around the world, offloaded into warehouses and processed here. The refineries extracted the sugar in various forms, and the goods were further packaged and distributed across the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to going to Spain to fight in the Civil War, Stephen had completed three years of service in the US Army, in the New York National Guard. He was part of the 71st Infantry, where he worked in the engineering office with two hundred people, making twenty-four dollars a week, which is the equivalent of $363.45 today. He joined the Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists and Technicians, which was a part of the CIO, the Congress of Industrial Organizations. During the 1930s, as unemployment among architects and draftsmen in the United States reached 90 percent or more, practitioners joined with other technical workers to form the Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists and Technicians (FAECT).&nbsp; From 1933 until after World War II, the FAECT served as a trade union and activist organization for the purpose of securing higher wages, employment benefits, and labor rights.&nbsp; During this time he lived at 113 East 3rd Street and 1st Avenue, NYC.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As he prepared to go to Spain, he received his passport, # 466079, on July 30, 1937.&nbsp; Stephen left for Spain, shortly afterwards, in August, 1937. He set sail aboard the <em>Queen Mary</em> on the 11th of the month. The construction of the Queen Mary ship began with a design completed in 1928, and while the actual building started in 1930, work was suspended several times and was finally completed in March of 1936.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On August 21, Zak arrived in Espolla, which is in Catalonia, Spain. After about five weeks, he joined the 15th Brigade of the Lincoln-Washington Battalion, and he was a member of Company 3. This lasted from October to December 7th, 1937, at which point, he changed companies. He moved from Company 3 to the Brigade MG Company, where he remained until March 12, 1938. After only a week with his new company, he took part in the Battle of Teruel which was a grueling struggle in which the Republican Army was able to kill around 57,000 Nationalist Rebels, but as many as 85,000 Republicans died, and to make matters worse, the battle ended with the Nationalists in control of the battlefield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On March 12, he moved to the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, until July 6, 1938. From July 6, to when he left Spain on December 20, 1938, he was a member of the 35th Division, Special MG Battalion, with whom he fought at the Battle of Fuentes de Ebro, which included the retreats and the Ebro Offensive, where, even though many of his friends within the battalion died in the attempt to claim victory, the Republican Army was decisively defeated and the territory loyal to the Spanish Republic was split in two. He returned to the US aboard the <em>Ausonia</em>. In 1939 RMS Ausonia was requisitioned by the Admiralty at the outbreak of World War II to serve as an armed merchant cruiser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the war, Stephen Zak had a fairly quiet life, he married Rhoda Loesberg, who was born on 13 July 1911. Her father, Abraham Paul Loesberg, was 27 and her mother, Esther Loesberg, was 25 at the time she was born.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stephen and Rhoda had a daughter, Linda Jane Zak Weintraub, born in 1942 in New York.

        "data": "<p>John &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; Harley Yellin was born on August 15, 1913, in West Sussex, Connecticut, to father Sam Yellin and mother Mary Yellin. His father was a liberal and/or a socialist while his mother was a socialist. They owned a small business. He studied architecture for 6 years at Brooklyn Technical. He lived in New York for some time and worked at Jay&rsquo;s Auto Service (likely his father&rsquo;s business). He was not part of any trade union in America, but he was a scoutmaster in the Boy Scouts of America, and was in the branch committee of the International Workers Order.<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\nYellin became interested in the proletariat movement in 1911 after attending some lectures and conferences in 1933, and through the International Workers Order. In 1934, he joined the Communist Party, and was in Section Two of the Bensonhurst Cell.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe joined the Republican side of the Spanish Civil War, as part of International Brigades, with no prior military experience. He left for Spain in March 1937 and arrived in either late March or in early April 1937. Initially, he was part of the First Battalion of the 13th--Jaroslav Dombrowski Polish--International Brigade, where he worked in the Service Sanitaire from April 21, 1937 to July 5, 1937 at C&oacute;rdoba.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe was in Brunete from July 6, 1937, to August 10, 1937. On July 23, 1937, he was wounded in the face and arms by shrapnel while loading patients into his ambulance, and stayed at the hospital at Hoyo de Manzanares for 7 to 8 days.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe worked as a mechanic and an ambulance driver at an Auto Park in Albacete from August 15, 1937 to April 15, 1938, where he became responsible for the American group. He was sentenced to 10 days of confinement in December 1937 due to a fight, which he thought was done &ldquo;merely to discredit [him].&rdquo; He went to guerilla school in Barcelona from April 15, 1938 to July 38, 1938. He became the administrator and political commissar of the International Brigade in Horta from July 1938 to October 1938. In all, he held the roles of Sergeant, Chief of Transport Section, Chief of Material of Transport Battalion, and Political Commissar.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYellin requested repatriation in September 1937, and returned to the U.S. on December 20, 1938 aboard the Ausonia. He later participated in World War Two in the U.S. Navy as a radar mechanic from April 1944 to December 1945.<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\nYellin spoke English, Spanish, and a bit of French and German. He was described as a &ldquo;good anti-fascist&rdquo; and &ldquo;politically reliable.&rdquo; He became a member of the Communist Party of Spain in late 1937, and joined the Young Communist League. He married Anne Yellin, and died on April 27, 1972.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>William James &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; Bailey, most notably as, Bill Bailey, was born on January 23, 1910. He grew up in Hoboken, New Jersey and in Jersey City, in a family of 13 children. Unfortunately, seven children died before the age of one, with just six children, including him, to remain. They lived in poverty due to their Irish identity which made it really hard to be employed during the early 1900&rsquo;s America. His parents eventually split due to his father&rsquo;s alcohol addiction and inability to earn enough money to support the family. As Bailey recalled, his father never had a paternal love for his family. He was arrested for constantly picking fights drunk and physically abusing his mother. When they finally split, Bailey noted his father&rsquo;s sense of liberation from the burden of being a father, which was heartbreaking for Bailey to see that his father resented them so much. They never met again until many years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nTo make sure that the family had enough to live by, Bailey&rsquo;s mother would go out to New York City Wall Street every day in search of a job. She would usually work as a maid and scrubbed floors. His sister, Kate would work at a church for 15 cents an hour, and his brother, John would work at a bakery. They were both eventually fired from their jobs when Kate ran away stealing a ham and when John stole doughnuts from the bakery shop. Because his family lived in such poverty, his brother would steal bottles of milk from other people, leading to his arrest to jail and reform school. Bailey went to Catholic school in St. Peters Church and had an education until he was in the fifth grade when his mother pulled him out of school in order to get a job and to start working. He later started to work for an Irishman that was living upstairs from him at the waterfront. He would work for six days a week for $21.52. After that, his family decided to move to New York near Hell&#39;s Kitchen, on West 38th Street between 9th and 10th Avenues for work. He eventually started sailing in 1929-1930 on a ferry boat at Pier 1 and earned $47 a month, which was considered a fortune at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHowever, he suffered from miserable working conditions, prompting him to join the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1929 and later, Marine Workers&rsquo; Industrial Union (MWIU) in 1930 to help fight for the rights and welfare of seamen. At first, he was hesitant about joining the Union, mainly because there was a fee that he had to pay every month for membership and he was at the time not able to afford it. However, once he joined, he was very invested and passionate about the causes they were fighting for. He became the union organizer. He eventually developed an interest in reading about the Soviet Union as he worked with members of a group of communists called the POC and later decided to become a member of the Communist Party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHis loyalty and enthusiasm as a communist member naturally caused him to be an anti-fascist along with the other members of his party. When word came out that an American seaman, Lawrence Simpson was arrested in Germany for bringing in anti-fascist literature, Bailey along with the other communist seamen decided to gather at the dock of a German ship, S.S. Bremen in New York, which was ready to sail from Pier 46 on 46th Street on July 26th, 1935. This act against fascism attracted the attention of thousands of people as they watched Bailey and a few other men cut the Bremen&rsquo;s swastika down and into the Hudson River. They were arrested but released and dismissed of any charges due to their courageous act against Nazism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNews about the war in Spain was spreading like wild-fire in New York where Bailey resided. He was very invested in the idea that action was finally being taken against fascism and sprang for the opportunity to volunteer in the war because he believed that if fascism can be defeated in the Spanish Civil War, then it can be defeated anywhere. He joined the Abraham Lincoln Battalion seamen&rsquo;s machine gun company sailing from his home address 191 (198) 11th Avenue, NYC (as stated in his passport) on June 16th, 1937 on the ship Aquitania, and arrived in Spain on June 31st, 1937. He rose to rank as the Company Commissar and was recognized for his bravery and strong will when fighting at Belchite and even managing to obtain a fascist banner which he sent back to the United States. On July 14th, 1937, the Lincoln Battalion merged with the George Washington Battalion after heavy losses from both sides. At the end of the Spanish Civil War, he returned on to the US on December 20, 1938, aboard the Ausonia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBailey&rsquo;s contributions to the fight against fascism do not end after the Spanish Civil War. He later served as a business agent for the Marine Firemen, Oilers, and Watertenders Union (MFOW), before joining and shipping himself out to the invasion of the Philippines as a mariner under MFOW working aboard the U.S flag vessels to prevent the risk of sending more and more men out to their deaths. Later in the Korean War (1950-1953), he was blacklisted from working in the Merchant Marine due to his membership in the Communist Party. In 1953 he began to work as a longshoreman and continued to do so until he retired in 1975.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBailey, recognized by his many contributions to the war effort continued to have a lasting impact to this day. He was in numerous documentaries including, Seeing Red (1983) and The Good Fight (1984). He also has his own autobiography dedicated to his son called, The Kid from Hoboken. Bill Bailey died on February 27, 1995, with his ashes spread across the sea. From working hard at the sea ever since he was little, joining unions and the Communist Party to help fight for his rights, to joining the Abraham Lincoln Brigades to help fight against fascism, Bill Bailey was definitely an honorable and strong fighter in support of his beliefs and passions until the very end.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>At the turn of the 20th century, New York City&rsquo;s garment industry experienced a rapid expansion, and with it came an influx of Eastern European Jewish immigrants seeking employment in the United States. Approximately 75% of the workers employed in this industry were Jewish, many of whom were attracted by the prospect of working for Jewish employers who could provide a familiar social environment as well as the opportunity to observe the Sabbath. Although, the rise in employment opportunities also meant that these workers were exposed to widespread exploitative conditions which subjected these individuals to hazardous working conditions for a relatively low pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAbraham &ldquo;Abe&rdquo; Schwartz was one of the many Jewish textile workers who witnessed the numerous investigations, labor strikes, and public demonstrations that occurred in response to the unsafe conditions many in the Jewish community had worked in. Which in turn, motivated his decision to not only embrace Leftist political ideology, but participate in the fight for democracy in the Spanish Civil War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOn February 28th, 1934, Schwartz received his passport (#80010), and listed his place of residence as 2187 Douglass street, Brooklyn, New York. He set sail on February 20th, 1937, lle de France, and arrived in Spain on March 14th, 1937.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nDuring his time in Spain, Schwartz served with the XV BDE, Washington Brigade, and died the night of Yom Kippur in the Villa Paz Hospital in May 1937 of Typhoid malignant malaria, military tuberculosis, and Lobar pneumonia. The following day, he was buried in the village cemetery of Saelices. During which, the Political Commissar spoke about Schwartz&rsquo;s achievements and his Antifascist work. As his coffin was lowered, the Spaniards attending the burial sang &ldquo;Internationale&rdquo;, in honor of his bravery during the war effort, and as a soldier who left his family and future behind to fight for democracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn a letter addressed to her brother, Rose Freed, Schwartz&rsquo;s bedside nurse, described the veteran as an amicable man. Schwartz had endeared all who met him, and became fast friends with many of the Spanish villagers living in Saelices. Freed was especially close to Schwartz, citing his death as the saddest experience she endured during her year-long stay in Spain. She explained that she was at his bedside when he died. His mind was still clear enough for him to speak about not only his own family, but also the issues he faced as a member of the working class.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Rose Freed was born on June 10, 1911, to a Polish Jewish family living on the East Side of New York. Her parents, Abraham and Dora Freed, were among the 2.2 million Polish immigrants who came to the United States in the late 19th century after suffering from insurgencies and famine in Poland. Rose had two older brothers, one older sister, and one younger sister. As an 18-year-old, Rose worked as a bookkeeper. However, she would soon realize her passion for helping others through medicine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRose completed her nursing training at Greenpoint Hospital in her twenties while taking classes at Columbia night school. She was a Brooklynite, living at 307 Berriman Street, Brooklyn, New York, located in the East New York neighborhood. After receiving her medical degree, Rose worked as a laboratory technician and microbiologist at Greenpoint Hospital. While she served the North Brooklyn community, Rose learned about the Spanish Civil War. Rose&rsquo;s affiliation with the Communist Party and her strong sympathy for the Republic compelled her to be a part of the good fight.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRose received her passport on January 12, 1937. A few days later, on January 16, 1937, Rose boarded the Paris, joining the first American hospital unit headed out to Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRose arrived in Spain on January 28, 1937. In a letter addressed to her friend Lou, Rose details her first moments upon arrival: &ldquo;[We] left Paris with John Langdon Davies, who recently wrote the book &ldquo;Spain Behind the Barricades,&rdquo; who saw us off to Cerbere. We traveled all afternoon and night. With the Pyrenees on one side and the blue Mediterranean on the other, it was really like entering Paradise. There is no country in the world more beautiful than Spain. It is hard to imagine a heinous war in this idyllic country. We stayed at Cerbere until late afternoon, at which time Spanish soldiers came up to escort us into Spain. We entered a large bus and started up the Pyrenees! The roads were perfect. For two hours we traveled up the mountain, and then to Port Bou. Radios installed in the trees shouted greetings to us. With our armed escorts and our uniforms the people were thrilled and cheered us wildly as the word got around as to who we were.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter spending two days in Port Bou, Rose and her peers left for Barcelona. She described to Lou her encounters with the Spanish people writing how it is &ldquo;impossible to tell you how the Spanish people have catered to us. There is nothing we wish that is not granted to us. They look upon us almost as saviors. I feel embarrassed when I remember that ours is a common cause. What suffering these people must have endured to display such gratefulness towards our puny aid!&rdquo; While in Barcelona, the Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy was invited as guests to the palace of Louis Company, President of Catalonia. Rose tells Lou later that night how she felt entranced by the palaces&rsquo; chandeliers, and how &ldquo;bitter the thought that Franco and his fascist horde is burning, plundering, destroying, yes, raping glorious Spain.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThough Rose&rsquo;s first few weeks in Spain may have felt like paradise, the reality of the war quickly set in. On March 20, 1937, Rose informed Lou that &ldquo;When I did not work 40 hours at one stretch I was a night charge nurse. In fact, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing just now. It is 5:30 am, and I&rsquo;ve just finished making the rounds of our three hospitals&mdash;giving medications and hypos and dressing wounds and circulation in the operation room.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnfortunately, working as a nurse did not protect Rose from falling victim to war casualties. During the Spanish Civil War, civilian bombing was a popular tactic used by Spanish nationalists and their allies. Many hospitals were impacted. While Rose was working in Taracon, one bomb fell about 5 yards from Hospital No. 3, crashing all windows and breaking the water main. Just the roar of planes could send a hospital room silent. To Lou, Rose explained that &ldquo;The crash&mdash;you cannot&mdash;never can anyone realize the horror of what seems like the earth opening beneath you&mdash;the light of the magnesium flare bomb to see if they struck right&mdash;and then eight more crashes&mdash;then silence, too long, and shrapnel flying in all directions.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs casualties from the war increased, the Medical Bureau suffered from shortages of beds, sheets, and pillowcases for wounded soldiers. Rose&rsquo;s letters to Lou were published to raise funds for supplies, via a pamphlet titled From a Hospital in Spain, Nurses Write. These letters presented an intimate picture of how nurses lived and worked in Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite these struggles, the spirit of the soldiers uplifted Rose. One soldier in particular, Morris Dashevsky, had an extraordinary impact on Rose. After being hit in the thigh by a sniper while carrying a wounded volunteer to safety, Morris was hospitalized at Plaza de Altazana in Albacete. Morris most likely met and fell in love with Rose here.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot long after meeting each other, Rose and Morris got married in Spain. On August 37, 1938 aboard the President Harding, Rose and Morris returned to America after discovering that Rose was pregnant. Together, they returned to Morris&rsquo; father&rsquo;s house in Massachusetts. By 1940, accompanied by Morris and their child, Rose returned to Brooklyn and lived in East Flatbush at 856 East 49 Street. Not much is known about Rose&rsquo;s life after returning from the war. Rose died in August 1968 in Brooklyn, New York.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Leslie Kish (originally L&aacute;szl&oacute; Kiss) was born on July 27, 1910, in Popra-Felka, Slovakia which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He is of Hungarian descent. In 1925, his family chose to immigrate to the US in a wave of Hungarian immigration. As the great Hungarian poet Attila Jozsef put it: &ldquo;one and a half million of our people staggered out to America.&rdquo; His father died soon after their arrival forcing Leslie, then 16, to work during the day and attend Bay Ridge Evening School at night to support his mother and 3 siblings. They settled at 335 East 79th Street, NY and his mother opened up a pastry shop in Manhattan. Kish went on to study at the City College of New York Evening School while working as a lab assistant at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. In 1937, he became a US citizen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy 1937, he only had a year left to complete his degree but instead chose to suspend his education and fight fascism in Spain. On March 14, he arrived in Spain as a volunteer for the Loyalists. There, he was initially assigned to a medical unit. Eventually, however, he met a Hungarian man at a bar who told him, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to go through basic training,&#39;&rdquo; he recalled. &ldquo;&lsquo;You go right to the front, we train you with the rifles, and you start shooting. And also, we have the best cooks.&#39;&rdquo; And so, Kish made his way to the front of the Hungarian Battalion and was injured in the Battle of Huesca in June of 1937. Afterward, he spent three weeks at the Benicasim Hospital and eventually joined the John Brown Battery which was positioned on the Estremadura Front from October through December 1937. They eventually relocated to the Toledo Front, where they remained until the Internationals were repatriated. By the end of the war, he was ranked Teniente (Lieutenant). He returned to NYC on February 4, 1939, aboard the SS President Harding. Kish resumed going to night school at City College and completed his BS in Mathematics cum laude.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1940, he moved to Washington DC and was hired by the US Census Bureau. A year later, he moved to the Division of Program Surveys of the Department of Agriculture and joined a group of social scientists that created a survey research unit. During World War II, he once again chose service to justice over his career, working as a meteorologist of the US Air Army Corps. In 1947, his research group went on to work at the University of Michigan and founded the Institute for Social Research, the world&rsquo;s largest academic survey and research organization. There he developed the Kish grid, a statistical randomized surveying method as well as sampling techniques that were used in the 1948 election to predict the victory of Harry Truman. There, he received his MA in mathematics and Ph.D. sociology, while also working full-time as a lecturer and researcher. Kish became Professor Emeritus of Sociology in 1981 and founded the Sampling Program for Foreign Statisticians which trains statisticians from developing countries. He passed away on October 7, 2000 at the age of 90. Since his death, the Institute of Social Research established the Leslie Kish International Fellowship which funds foreign students studying survey sampling.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Jack Waters, better known as Samuel Wiederhorn, was a Jewish New Yorker, born on August 11, 1911, in eastern Bronx. He spent 4 years in the military as a mechanic for the 104th Artillery regiment from 1928 to 1931, enlisting after having received a high school diploma (no info found on attended schools). He became a member of the Young Communists&#39; league during this time, as a unit organizer and later mechanic in 1933. Due to this, he had a military background previously to joining the fight in the Spanish Civil War. In 1935, he received a Spanish passport from the Soviet Union, and in 1937 flew from Moscow to Spain along with other members of the Lincoln Battalion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Initially low grade, he became Adjutant Commander and later promoted to Commissar of his unit, while also being the unit&#39;s gun lieutenant. He was described by Sam Carsman in his memoir as someone who maintained good relations with members of his unit. A moment specifically described is when he led his unit on a drunken half-naked midnight drill in the snow, leaving many of the Spaniards there bewildered. From 1937 on, the John Brown Battery (which he was a part of) stayed on the Toledo Front, experiencing little action, until being sent back in 1939 along with the other international brigades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the war in Spain was over, Wiederhorn&#39;s story was not finished yet. Now a hardened veteran, Wiederhorn joined the U.S. army as a 1st Lieutenant, although not much of his story is known during the war. Judging from the 1940 census, it seems that Wiederhorn may have been an Insurance Agent for the rest of his life, and kept close ties with other members of his family, such as Max Wiederhorn, another known communist.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly enough, both he and Max were put on a list of suspected communists in 1956, and as to whether or not they had continued to be communists up to this point, is entirely up for debate. In 1998, aged 86 years old, Samuel Wiederhorn died in the Upper West Side, and was buried in, surprisingly, a graveyard in Calverton, Suffolk County, far from his previously-known family or home.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Milan Zecovic (other spellings include Miljan Zekovi\u0107, Zecevich, Zecevio, and Zecevigh) was born on October 10th, 1911 to Peter and Mary Zecovic in Gary, Indiana and would be raised there at 13-29 Delaware avenue. A city that was founded only a few years prior to his birth, Gary, Indiana experienced rapid growth as it was home to the steel plant Gary Works that his father likely worked at. By 1920 Gary, Indiana was nearly 30% foreign born all likely coming from Eastern European countries in pursuit of industry jobs during the Industrial Revolution. Milan&rsquo;s own parents were immigrants from Yugoslavia which today is split into seven countries. His last name and the fact that he also speaks Russian indicate his family was specifically from Serbia. Zecovic would only complete eight years of primary and middle school before presumably joining the work force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He would later move to New York City and live at 550 West 20th street where he would work as a seaman and be a charter of the National Maritime Union which fell under the Congress of Industrial Organizations. While working there he would make a yearly salary of $85 (about $1400 today). While he lived in New York he would be politically affiliated with the American Labor Party. Milan would be recruited for the war effort by Edward Lasky of unit 140 district 8 member of Chicago Builders. With aid from the communist party, he would arrive in Spain on July 27, 1937 aboard the Agullan citing in the Biografia de Militantes that his reason to join the war was in order to fight against Fascism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Biografia de Militantes as well as the War Commissariat of the International Brigades, that he likely filled up prior to his departure from Spain, also revealed more personal facts about him. He states that he had not taken any classes on politics, and the newspapers he read the most were the Daily Worker, The Communist, and New Masses- all leftist publications. He also stated that the book he used to learn about the communist doctrine was the Fundamentals of Leninism. Many of his personal opinions were demonstrated in these documents too. For example, he states that the 13 Points of the Government of National Union, which outlined the government Spanish Republican Government&rsquo;s Premier Dr. Negrin wished to follow should the republic when the war, was the &ldquo;best thing that could happen&rdquo;. He also goes on to state that in his opinion the People&rsquo;s front policy in Spain is &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; and that he has and never would have any positive interactions with Trotskyists. However, much of what he says in these personal statements should not be immediately believed since many of those fighting on the left who weren&rsquo;t pro-Stalin (Like those a part of the CNT and POUM) would often be purged, so he likely was motivated to ensure nothing he stated could be wrongly interpreted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After his arrival he was detached to an instruction unit for approximately a month and then dispatched to the 24th Battalion-15th Brigade. He would apply for membership in the Communist Party of the USA on November 6, 1937, stating in a letter that he would like to join because he agrees with their program and principles entirely. However, he wouldn&rsquo;t become an officially registered communist until March of 1938 while he was in Catalonia. In the War Commissariat, he states that he intended to specialize in using machine guns and other similar weaponry. The first battle he took part in was the Battle of Belchite, which was a Republican offensive intended to slow down Nationalist advancements in the north which also doubled as the republic using it to decrease Anarchist and POUM influence in the region by bringing in communist troops. It was here on September 5th, 1937, when he volunteered to try and bomb a barricade but was shot in the hand and twice near the left lung. He would spend two months in a hospital in Benicasim then in hospitals at Tarragona and Caldas for an undisclosed amount of time. During this time, his commanders would commend him for his bravery at the Battle of Belchite in December 1937. He would also fight in the Battle of Teruel, which was one of the bloodiest battles and a decisive win for Franco. Zecovic would be promoted to an infantry corporal because of his great fighting during this battle. Milan would also participate in the Aragon Offensive, Catalonia Offensive, and the Ebro Offensive which was the longest and largest battle of the war. He would be injured once more on the Serra de Pandols, likely during the Ebro offensive, on August 27, 1938 where he would suffer getting hit with shrapnel, a shell containing bullets or pieces of metal timed to burst short of impact, from a mortar, a lightweight muzzle-loaded weapon, to his legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;He arrived back to the United States on December 20th, 1938, aboard the Ausonia. However, prior to him leaving Spain his superiors wrote a report on his conduct throughout his service. The report states that although he was a great soldier at the front and preferred to be with Spanish comrades, he was politically very weak unstable, and he talked too much without thought. In a section provided for a supplementary explanation one of his superiors goes so far as to say &ldquo;[Zecovic is] a very contradictory character at all times. Undoubtedly means well but is absolutely unstable on any subject.&rdquo; It seems however that most of the positive comments come from one set of handwriting and the negative from another, indicating that perhaps these two superiors had very different interactions with Zecovic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After serving In Spain, Zecovic would spend a short while in America. Then, he would go on to&nbsp;enlist as a Merchant Marine during World War II. Unfortunately, on December 19, 1941, only a few days after the United States officially declared war on the axis forces, the hog Islander Prusa would be torpedoed into the Atlantic Ocean and Zecovic would die serving as bosun of the vessel.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

She lived in Manhattan and worked at the Bellevue Hospital and arrived in Spain on January 26th, 1937 to serve as a nurse with the American Hospital Unit. Her husband, Jack Liffland, shortly after joined Sally in Spain and was assigned to Transport. Jack&rsquo;s mobility in Transport allowed him to visit Sally often, usually towards the end of her shifts. Though Jack later served as a rank Sargento soldier with the Abraham Lincoln Brigades and fought all over Spain at Jarama, Quinto, and Belchite, the couple found ways to stay close with each other.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nA letter from Jack and Sally, dated January 1st, 1938, detailed their locations as Jack fighting at Albacete, while Sally volunteered at Villanueva de la Jara, only 40 miles north. Only a few weeks after, Jack was re-stationed and reported missing in action during the Ebro Offensive. Sally, hopeful for her husband&rsquo;s return, quickly grew mentally and physically sick as she failed to hear any news. Forced to return home for rest, Sally left Spain for her apartment at 226 East 12th St in the East Village. Not long after, Leo Rosenberg, a friend of Jack and Sally and the recipient of the letter, reached out to Sally. Worried about her sickly appearance and poor eating habits, Leo and his wife offered to take in Sally and care for her at their home. With time, Sally gained back her strength and appeared slightly more cheerful. Soon thereafter, Sally left the couple, and though the date of her death is unknown, the reason for her death was reported as an &ldquo;overtaxed heart.&rdquo; As a close friend, Leo understood Sally as a beautiful and kind soul who exhibited a deep love for humanity, and her husband. Jack&rsquo;s death borne unto Sally a heavy burden of loneliness, sorrow, and despair. However, Sally&rsquo;s legacy as a selfless and passionate volunteer who saved numerous wounded soldiers continues to leave a mark, even after her death.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Irving J. Rifkin was born on March 4, 1917 in Brooklyn, New York. His parents, Julius Rifkin and Clara Schneider, were Russian Jewish immigrants. His father would later be drafted in the Second World War, and was a high-ranking member of the Cambridge Masonic lodge, along with all six of his brothers. He had one younger brother, Victor, an older sister, Florence, and an older brother, Charles. The census records of his family indicate that they likely lived at 3916 Laurel Ave, just over a mile west of Coney Island. In 1935, while he was a pre-medical student at City College, he joined the Communist party. While in college, he participated in the ROTC program, which likely motivated his decision to fight in Spain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter graduating from City College in spring 1938, he boarded the Queen Mary which arrived in Spain on July 16 1938. Rifkin&rsquo;s family did not know he was going to fight in Spain until they received a letter he wrote on July 14. He also sent a postcard to his close friend and actor Robert Martin Loewer. The postcard was one of many by Spanish Republicans which depicted the failed uprising against the Republic led by General Jos&eacute; Sanjurjo in 1932. The description on the postcard reads &ldquo;Sanjurjo, the incarnation of the absolutist spirit of the typical Spanish Army commander, leads in Seville an armed uprising against the first Government of the Republic, and flees to Portugal without waiting for the outcome.&rdquo; Sanjurjo supported the Nationalist rebels, but was unable to join in on the fighting, as he died in a plane crash on July 20th, 1936. These postcards were intended to boost morale and convince the soldiers that they were not fighting a lost cause. On the card, he wrote &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sending this card from Spain, as you may know by this time. The war is just two years old today and the Spanish people, old peasant women, kids all still show magnificent enthusiasm. They can never be beaten.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRifkin served in the Third Company of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the summer and autumn of 1938. He took part in the Battle of the Ebro, which was the largest battle of the Civil War by length and number of soldiers. Despite some initial successes by the Republican forces during the battle, the engagement eventually turned into a war of attrition. The air support provided by Germans and Italians allowed Franco to regroup and push back the Republicans. On September 3rd, 1938, Franco successfully launched a counterattack from the town of Gandesa, and managed to capture the strategically important town of Corbera. Rifkin and several other members of the Third Company were in Corbera when it fell to the Nationalists, and they were captured on September 7th. His ultimate fate is unknown, although he was likely executed shortly after his capture. His last letter to his family was sent two weeks prior on August 24th.</p>\r\n",

He spent 2 years in the US Navy, worked as a dress cutter, and joined the Communist Party in 1934. Around this time, the Comintern (Communist International) worked to recruit American volunteers to fight in the Spanish Civil War. Those who did were instructed to apply for a passport and received uniforms and limited training. Abramowitz was one of these volunteers, and he obtained his passport in December of 1936. He had two addresses listed: 1448 40th Street, Brooklyn New York and Bronx, New York. The former was in Borough Park, a neighborhood populated with many Jewish immigrants. Given that his address was in a predominantly Jewish populated area and that his name was listed on the Jewish Virtual Library website as a possible Jewish volunteer, Abramowitz probably attended one of the numerous private yeshivas in the neighborhood that most Jewish children attended in place of public schools. Additionally, it is uncertain if he was part of the International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union (ILGWU), a labor union made up of garment workers and that was affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, but it is likely due to the presence of many Jewish immigrants and New Yorkers in the organization.<br /><br />Just 4 days after receiving his passport, Abramowitz and the other volunteers boarded the Normandie ship and arrived in Spain in 11 days. He served with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade with people from all over the world and was later promoted to First Sergeant.<br /><br />In February 1937, Francisco Franco ordered the Nationalist army, which included soldiers from the Army of Africa, to attack the valley of Jarama, in hopes of cutting off the main road between Madrid and Valencia after failing to overtake the capital. His goal was to stop vital supplies of food, fuel, and munitions from reaching the Republicans in Madrid. With the Republican Army, the International Brigade arrived just in time to halt the attack. In the face of elite soldiers equipped with weapons sent by Hitler and Mussolini, the fighters of the International Brigade were at a huge disadvantage; they lacked experience and proper training. Yet, they were eager and determined to fight against the idea of fascism and for Spanish democracy. In the end, both sides faced heavy losses, with 10,000 deaths on the Republican side and 5,000 on the Nationalist side.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Abramowitz was one of the many who were killed in action in Jarama. It was said that he was shot through the head while observing through the sights of a major general. There are different dates of death provided, but his cemetery record indicates April 5, 1937. Other dates include March 37, April 3, and May 12 of the same year. He was 27 when he died.</p>",

        "data": "<p>In 1915, Moses (Moe) Fishman was born in New York City. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School and enrolled at City College. Due to the financial burden of attending university, Fishman never completed his degree. Before volunteering to join the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, Moe Fishman was part of a number of anti-fascist groups. Fishman&rsquo;s anti-fascist sentiment grew as he researched Hitler and Mussolini. This led him to join the Young Men&#39;s&#39; Hebrew Association. There, he actively participated in the campaign against the United States&rsquo; participation in the 1936 Olympics because it was being held in Germany. As an anti-fascist, he refused to support this, so he later joined the Young Communist League at the 92nd St YMCA. At the time, they were the most active group against the Olympics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt just 21-years-old, Moe Fishman decided to volunteer to fight in Spain in April of 1937. His parents were not supportive of his choice. Moe Fishman had no prior experience in fighting, so it was understandable that his parents did not want him to do this. When Fishman volunteered, he was just working as a truck driver. When he was later accepted to be a part of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade as a truck driver, he called his parents after he made the decision to go. At that point, it was too late for Fishman to go back on his decision. He was committed to going despite his parents&#39; wishes. The&nbsp;only thing that Fishman brought with him to Spain was his toothbrush.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, Fishman did not go directly to Spain. He and others first went to France. There were 40 or 50 other men with him on this journey. While in France, Fishman and a group of 6 other men were hiding with farmers. They used buckets as toilets and were only allowed to go outside at nighttime. These were some of the precautions that they took because they did not want to be caught by other people. When it was safe to leave France, Fishman and the other men who were hiding got on a bus to the Pyrenees mountains. Fishman and the other volunteers would have to cross this mountain on foot to reach Spain.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs they were climbing over the mountains, they were warned about straying from the group. If someone got lost, they were instructed to stay put and wait for someone to come looking for them. In an interview, Fishman recalled that he had heard of people who got lost whose bodies were never found. Eventually, Fishman safely reached Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He recalled that the Republic had bought weapons from Mexico and Czechoslovakia. They also obtained weapons from the Soviet Union. He said that although the weapons were backward compared to that of Hitler&rsquo;s army, they were doable. However, the Republic was outnumbered in terms of weapons and ammunition. In 1937, they were outnumbered by 7 to 1. By the end of the war, they were outnumbered by 11 to 1. Despite the disadvantages that the Republic had, Fishman was eager to fight the Fascists.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis first battle in Spain was the Brunete Offensive. Unfortunately, he was shot in the thigh and severely wounded. He said that if the Republic had not won that battle, it is likely that he would not be alive at the time of the interview. He had to lay on the ground, unable to move the whole day until people could safely transport him to Hospital 16. There, they temporarily set his knee with pins. Fishman was in and out of hospitals the whole time that he was in Spain. He was hopeful that he would be able to recover to see more fighting in Spain but never did. He did, however, recover enough to fight as a merchant marine in World War II.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFishman never regretted fighting in Spain because he was so strongly anti-fascist. In fact, he went on to be a board member of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade organization (VALB). It was the first of its kind as it offered rehabilitation services, such as access to jobs and medical treatment. When the organization was first formed, they faced strong opposition from the government. They labeled it as a communist organization and even passed the subversive activist control act, which specifically targeted members of the VALB. The act demanded that all communists register as so. Failure to comply resulted in a fine of $1000 each day that they did not register as a communist and a year&#39;s worth of time served in jail. However, Moe Fishman and the rest of the board fought this in court and won.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrough it all, Moe Fishman had an unwavering commitment to defeating fascism. In addition to helping the veterans, Fishman also worked closely with the Joint Anti-Fascist Committee to help Spaniards settle into new and better lives. They helped Spaniards go to places in Latin America where they could safely reside and sent them resources like food, money, and clothes. They also sent care packages to jails where Spanish refugees were being held. Fishman worked tirelessly to fight fascism and helped rehabilitate those affected by it.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Maurice Conway was born on April 21, 1908 in Olympia, Washington. This was the time when the historic White Building was built, one of the oldest existing buildings in Olympia, that represented the booming economy of early 20th century Olympia. He and his family were part of the hundreds of thousands of Irish immigrants that were impoverished. However, the 1900s was also a time of economic improvement as it was more commonplace for immigrants to reach higher rankings in the workplace. He was born into a family of five, being the middle child. His father was Michael Conway who died at age 46 (1869-1915), and his mother was Catherine Machin who has an unknown death date (1877-?). His older brother was Thomas Joseph Conway who also had an unknown death date (1906-?), and his younger sister was Mary Conway Philumalee who died at age 70 (1910-1980). Having died at age 38, Maurice did not outlive either his father or sister.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaving been religious, he attended the California Theological School in the 1930s where he studied medicine. He lived in San Francisco, California during the time. However, he decided to have a shift in his studies and moved to 58 South Oxford, Brooklyn, New York on July 23, 1937 to take on the occupation of a Marine Carpenter. The job entailed constructing and repairing the structure of ships. Throughout his years, there was no mention of a serious romantic relationship.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUpon hearing about the civil war occurring in Spain, Maurice Conway was compelled to join the fight. His religious beliefs played a role in the motivation of fighting for human rights and battling against atrocity and devastation of fascism. He joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, a group of around 3,000 volunteers from the United States that were sent to aid the Republican forces against the Nationalist forces. He left New York on July 28, 1937 and sailed aboard the Queen Mary. Upon arriving in Spain on August 8, 1937, he and his comrades had to feign being students or researchers in order to avoid confiscation of citizenship and other such dire consequences. This was because President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared neutrality in the Spanish Civil War due to a desire to focus on domestic issues as the United States was still recovering from the Great Depression. Measures were taken, including restricting citizens from participating in any Nationalist or Republican efforts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Spain, Maurice Conway served with the XV Brigade, Lincoln Battalion, a battalion composed of individuals from the United States, Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. The battalion&rsquo;s role was home defense. There were no racial discriminatory acts at play as there was an integration of White and Black people. The battalion consisted of soldiers, technicians, medical personnel, and aviators. Initially, the battalion consisted of two infantry and one machine gun. After a training period of two months (really, telling individuals who have never laid their hands before on guns to shoot), the soldiers were sent to battle. These soldiers were thought of as shock troops, thus suffering heavy losses. As part of the Lincoln Battalion, Maurice Conway was involved in the Battle of Jarama (the unit lost \u2154 of its strength and their commander), the Villanueva de la Ca&ntilde;ada (the second day of the Battle of Brunete Offensive), and the &ldquo;Mosquito Ridge&rdquo; (commander Oliver Law killed in action). After such heavy casualties experienced in the battles, the Lincoln and Washington Battalions were forced to merge - the unit was then officially labeled the Lincoln-Washington Brigade. Proceeding battles include the Aragon Offensive, Battle of Quinto, Battle of Belchite, Battle of the Ebro, and Battle of Teruel. It is noted that the Lincoln-Washington Brigade lost 22.5% of its strength by the end of the war.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaurice Conway was then transferred to the Brigade of Service Sanitaire, where he utilized the medical skills he obtained from the California Theological School. His role included upholding the health of the soldiers through sanitation checks. During this time, however, he was captured at the Siege of Gandesa sometime between July and November 1938. He obtained the status of prisoner of war, POW, as he was captured by the Nationalist forces. One can only imagine the torture he would have experienced during his capture. He was ultimately exchanged on October 8, 1938 and returned to the United States ten days on October 18, 1938 afterwards, again on the Queen Mary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen WWII began on September 1, 1939, Maurice Conway decided to participate again, joining the Allied forces as a Merchant Marine. He utilized the skills he gained as a Marine Carpenter. He was responsible for supplying the raw materials, arms, ammunition, fuel, and food to the Allies (France, Great Britain, United States, Soviet Union). He lived past the end of WWII, having contributed to the success of the Allies. Maurice Conway died a year later on February 18, 1946. It is debated to be either suicide (perhaps due to his experience as a POW) or murder as his body was found in the East River.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Thomas Page was born on September 29th, 1909. He only attended 2 years of high school, and as a young African American in New York City, he experienced a lot of difficulty finding jobs. When the Great Depression hit, this struggle became worse, and he resorted to making and selling illegal alcohol. During the Great Depression, the Communist Party worked to organize Unemployed Councils from the third of the population that was jobless. Page joined the Unemployed Councils, protesting for jobless support and more opportunities for workers. As he saw it, &ldquo;it was the Communist Party who did everything, everyone else just talked&rdquo;. Thus, following many involved in the Unemployed Councils, Page joined the Communist Party.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPage seemed to have planned for his involvement in Spain long in advance, obtaining a passport in 1934. At the time, he was living at 14 Randall Court Rockville Center in Long Island, just outside of Queens. He enlisted on February 18th, 1934, and finally went to Spain on March 10th, 1937 aboard the Washington. Once in Spain, he was assigned to drive a truck towards the Cordoba Front. After this mission, he was assigned to the machine gun company in the 20th International Battalion. Afterwards, he joined the International Brigade Auto Park, again as a driver. Due to the high numbers of casualties in the Battle of Brunete, the Washington Battalion and Abraham Lincoln Battalion were merged, forming the Lincoln-Washington (or simply Lincoln) Battalion. This was the Anglo-American battalion Page joined. He became a squad leader within the Battalion, helping to train new Spanish conscripts, as the international battalions became mixed with Spanish soldiers. In the Ebro campaign, he was cited twice for bravery, sustaining two wounds to his shoulder and stomach and remaining in a hospital for much of the rest of his time in Spain. On December 10th, 1938 he took a Cunard Line ship, the RMS Ausonia, back to New York City. Though his time there was under a year, he experienced both the hardship and triumph that was the international battalions in Spain, later recounting in an interview, &ldquo;You give it everything you possibly can. You go out there with no shoes on, you go out there unabrigados(1), you go out there without an overcoat. You wanna win. You don&rsquo;t get cold, you don&rsquo;t get hot, you stick, you stay, you wanna win. That&rsquo;s what it means. I&rsquo;ve been so cold my hands are like, I couldn&rsquo;t open them up, but I didn&rsquo;t mind the cold. You wanna win. Other people, they wanna win. Slept under a little bit of straw, no blanket over you, but you gotta win. Wear a pair of overalls...and it&rsquo;s cold in Spain, it&rsquo;s very cold in Spain, but you wanna win: you&rsquo;re staying.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBack in New York City, he continued to be a stable member of the Communist Party, working as a guard for the Soviet Pavilion at the 1939 World&rsquo;s Fair. He also took up work as a guard for the New York fur market, likely using his experience fighting in the Spanish Civil War as credentials. When World War II broke out, he jumped at the chance to again fight Fascism, joining the U.S. Army. He likely felt the stark difference in experience between this and the Spanish Civil War, as he was again in a segregated environment. He was assigned to Company C, 376th Engineering Brigade, and served in North Africa, France, and Italy. After the war, he took up camera work, working both to repair cameras and as a photographer. During the second red scare and McCarthyism, he was of course questioned and followed by the FBI, but his stubbornness led them to move on. He died in April, 1985.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(1) The phrase is unclear in the interview, but it seems like he is using a Spanglish phrase coming from the word &lsquo;abrigados&rsquo;, which can mean people wearing jackets. Thus &lsquo;unabrigados&rsquo; means jacket-less people, which he translates in the next clause: without an overcoat.</p>\r\n",

        "data": "<p>Jack Koble was born on April 20, 1913, in Brooklyn, New York, to a working-class family of Lithuanian and Romanian descent. Growing up in a Lithuanian immigrant community, he experienced cultural institutions and confronted discrimination and animosity. Jack took up the profession of an auto mechanic and joined the Young Communist League (YCL) due to his passion for social justice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn 1937, at 23 years old, Koble responded to the Spanish Republic&#39;s plea for international assistance against General Francisco Franco&#39;s fascist troops. He acquired a passport and set sail on the Ile de France on February 20, 1937. Upon reaching Spain on March 7, Koble enlisted with the 2nd Squadron, 1st Regiment de Tren and became a member of the Lincoln Brigade&mdash;comprising over 2,800 volunteers from various backgrounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThese Abraham Lincoln Brigade soldiers would have been part of the Republican forces defending their positions. They faced well-established opponents with superior weaponry, including tanks and artillery. The February 1937 Battle of Jarama tested their bravery and resolve. They participated in intense fighting, withstanding artillery shelling and machine gun fire while forming tight bonds with their Spanish comrades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn July 1937, during the Battle of Brunete, the Abraham Lincoln Brigade faced new challenges as urban warfare took center stage against well-protected Nationalist positions. Engaging in close-quarters fighting against fortified enemies tested their perseverance. The soldiers bore heavy fighting, sniper attacks, and ongoing counterattack risks while demonstrating courage and determination in pursuit of their goals.<br />\r\nThe summer of 1938 saw the Battle of Ebro as a crucial turning point in the conflict. Soldiers from the Abraham Lincoln Brigade played an essential role in this last significant offensive by the Republicans. As they crossed the Ebro River under enemy gunfire, they encountered treacherous landscapes and robust defensive setups. They faced fierce opposition and battled intensely against Franco&#39;s troops. Despite their heroic actions, the Battle of Ebro concluded in a Republican loss, emphasizing the overwhelming obstacles they encountered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter Spain, Koble returned to the US on October 1, 1938, aboard the ship Paris. His Spanish experiences and dedication to combating fascism left an indelible mark on his life. Following World War II&#39;s outbreak, Jack Koble served in the US Army from June 24, 1943, with ground combat being an integral aspect of the war effort and infantry soldiers like Koble assuming a critical role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nUpon the war&#39;s end, Koble settled in Brooklyn, New York, where he ran an auto repair business near the corner of Bay 34th Street and Cropsey Avenue. He married Pearl E. Koble, and together they had a son named Richard (Dick) Koble. Jack Koble&#39;s journey from a working-class immigrant background to his service in Spain and the US Army exemplified the American dream. His dedication to fighting for a better world, both abroad and at home, reflects the values of courage, resilience, and a commitment to justice.<br />\r\nIn conclusion, Jack Koble&#39;s life story encapsulates a remarkable journey. Despite facing discrimination and hostility, Koble went to war and fought to make the world a better place not once, but twice, and was able to run a business and start his own family afterwards.</p>\r\n",
