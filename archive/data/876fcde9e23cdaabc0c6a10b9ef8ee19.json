    "data": "<p>William Allen Van der Roest was born in Canada in 1913. At some point in his life, he came to live in New York City (specifically, 228 West 111th Street in Harlem), and at the age of 24, he decided to enlist to go fight in Spain. After obtaining a passport on March 29, 1937, he left New York aboard the Aquitania (an ocean liner that was sailing from New York to Cherbourg and Southampton) just 2 days later. Following his arrival in Spain (presumably coming from Cherbourg along with several other volunteers who also departed New York aboard the Aquitania on March 31st) in April, he eventually became the secretary of his company within the Lincoln Battalion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn July 6th, 1937, the Lincoln, Washington, and British Battalions were sent to serve as part of the offensive at Brunete against the Nationalists. They were sent to capture the town of Villanueva de la Ca&ntilde;ada and ended up spending the entire day engaged in a brutal struggle that was ultimately inconclusive. They were sent back to break the stalemate at the town the next day, and although they did manage to take the town, they suffered heavy casualties. Among those casualties was Van der Roest, who was killed during an attack by Nationalist aircraft. His demise was personally witnessed by Carl Syvanen, a fellow member of the Lincoln Battalion who would go on to recount the story in the Finnish novel Meid&auml;n Poikamme Espanjassa (Our Boys in Spain).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInterestingly enough, Van der Roest is claimed as a member of both the Lincoln Battalion and the Canadian-centric Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion: he was killed before ever getting the chance to join the &quot;Mac-Paps&quot; (as Syvanen later would) but is still listed among those Canadians who gave their life in service of the Republic (it is unclear whether or not he would have wanted to be remembered as a Canadian or an American, but his hometown is still remembered as New York).</p>\r\n",
