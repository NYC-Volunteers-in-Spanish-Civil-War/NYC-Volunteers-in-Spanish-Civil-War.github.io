	<p>
	  The Spanish Civil War began in 1936 when a group of disaffected Spanish army officers
	  staged a coup d’etat against the democratically-elected Spanish Republic. The
	  participation of the Popular Front (which included a small number of Communists) in that
	  government was used as a justification by these army officers and their conservative
	  supporters. Early on, the fascist dictators Hitler & Mussolini backed the rebels, whom
	  the press would come to refer to as the Nationalists. On the other side, a coalition of
	  labor unions, anarchists, and liberals armed themselves to defend the Republic. Their
	  defense of the capital, Madrid, attracted global attention and drew many writers and
	  artists to Spain to document the struggle. Ultimately, left wing parties, but
	  predominantly, the Communist Party used an international network to organize volunteers
	  to fight for the Republic. The Abraham Lincoln Brigade was the American volunteer
	  unit. Many New Yorkers joined this unit, and many of them were indeed Communists, but it
	  would be perhaps more accurate to say that they were all opposed to the spread of
	  fascism. This was what united them.

	</p>
	<p>
	  The Republic fought valiantly, but without the aid of its fellow democracies, most
	  importantly France, Britain, and the United States, it was simply outgunned. The Soviet
	  Union did provide aid, but at the cost of stifling dissent. And it was never enough to
	  tip the scales decisively against the Nationalist side, where career army officer,
	  Francisco Franco, emerged as the leader of fascist Spain, personally meeting with
	  Hitler.

	</p>
	<p>
	  Terrible atrocities occurred on both sides. Neighbors murdered neighbors, and Franco
	  encouraged colonial troops to attack civilians. Much of what was to come in World War
	  II (1939-1945) was foreshadowed by the war in Spain. More civilians died than soldiers,
	  for instance. This new type of warfare was famously depicted in Pablo Picasso’s
	  painting, “Guernica”.

	</p>
	<p>
	  The war ended in 1939, just months before World War II began. Persecution of people
	  involved with the Popular Front or labor unions continued for decades in Spain. Not
	  until Franco’s Death in 1975, did Spain begin to move again towards democracy. It is
	  still grappling with how to confront the history of the war and its aftermath.
