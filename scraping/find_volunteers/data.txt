Vernon Beebe                   ----      http://www.alba-valb.org/volunteers/vernold-masten-beebe
Vernon Masten Beebe was born in Brooklyn on December 9, 1911. In August 1938, along with ten other Americans, Beebe arrived at Le Havre, France, as a stowaway aboard the Normandie. Immediately arrested, Beebe and seven of the other stowaways stated that they were en route to Spain to join the International Brigade. The spokesman for the group, Henry Ulanoff, declared that several of them had been refused passports and that stowing away was the only way they could reach Spain. After two months in jail, Beebe was placed aboard the Ile de France bound for the United States. State Department personnel collected Beebe's temporary traveling papers after the ship docked in New York on October 31, 1938. Evidence suggests that a black volunteer named Beebe did serve in Spain before this incident occurred. It is not clear if this person is the same Vernold Masten Beebe. ~ Chris Brooks

Alvah Bessie                   ----      http://www.alba-valb.org/volunteers/alvah-bessie
During his brief stay in France, he worked as a rewrite man at the Paris-Times, and wrote "Redbird," his first short story to receive publication. He returned to New York in 1929, and for the next six years, his stories, essays, and reviews appeared in The New Republic, Scribner's, Atlantic Monthly, Saturday Review of Literature, Collier'sand Story. In July 1930, he married Mary Burnett, a puppet-maker and artist. The couple moved to Vermont and had two boys -- Daniel and David. Bessie began work on his first novel, Dwell in the Wilderness. During this time, Bessie also began to study Marxist theory and question his political convictions. Bessie was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship following the publication of his novel in 1935, and, with his family, returned to New York. Back in the City, Bessie began to move in more radical circles, and in 1936 he became a member of the Communist Party. In 1935 he joined the staff of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, serving as drama and book editor. His tenure at the paper was marked by dissent. His radical stance on striking maritime workers in 1936 and on the Spanish Civil War ran counter to management's more conservative views. A final dispute with the paper stemmed from his praise of French novelist and aviator Andre Malraux's efforts to organize a squadron of French flyers to aid the Spanish Republic. In 1937 he resigned from the Eagle and went to work in the public relations office of the Spanish Information Bureau, a New York agency of the Republican Government.

Ramon Durem                    ----      http://www.alba-valb.org/volunteers/ramon-durem
Born in 1915 in Seattle, Washington, Ramon Durem left home at fourteen and joined the Navy. Discharged following an injury to a leg, Durem worked as a laborer along the West Coast. He eventually enrolled at the University of California in Berkeley and joined the Communist party in 1931. Active in various radical causes on campus, Durem was arrested for picketing against silk imports from Japan. Durem left for Europe, aboard the Aquitania, on March 31, 1937. During the Brunete Offensive, an enemy bullet struck Durem in the same leg that had been injured in the Navy. While recuperating at the American base hospital at Villa Paz, Durem met, courted and married a nurse from Brooklyn, Rebecca Schulman. In the summer of 1938 when the front lines broke and the hospital had to be evacuated, Durem returned to the XVth Brigade and served throughout the remainder of the Retreats and the Ebro Offensive. Durem was among the Americans who participated in the farewell parade in Barcelona and returned to the United States aboard the Ausonia on December 20, 1938. Durem and his wife moved to Los Angeles where they had three daughters. Durem continued to be an active union organizer and was arrested on a number of occasions. During the 1940s Durem discovered an African American identity. He separated from his wife, remarried--this time to an African American woman--and moved his new family to Guadalajara, Mexico in order to escape government harassment. In 1962 Durem and his family returned to reside in Los Angeles. In the late 1940s Durem began writing poetry under the name of "Ray Durem." His poems were first published in the Crusader, a journal edited by Robert Williams, the North Carolina-based Black Nationalist leader who in the 1960s was forced into exile in Cuba and China. Other poems were published in the literary journals Phylon and Venture and in the Herald Dispatch newspaper. Durem's early poems attracted the interest of Langston Hughes, and in the mid-1950s Hughes tried unsuccessfully to help Durem secure a publisher. Hughes did include one of Durem's poems in the anthology New Negro Poets: USA. In the early 1960s Durem saw selections of his poetry published in the Heritage anthology Sixes and Sevens and in the New York literary magazine Umbra 2. A volume of Durem's poetry entitled Take No Prisoners (1971) was published in London posthumously. In 1963, at the age of forty-eight, Ray Durem died of cancer in Los Angeles. ~ Chris Brooks

Irving   Fishgold              ----      http://www.alba-valb.org/volunteers/irving-fishgold
Isidore (Irving) Fishgold (1918-1938) was born in Brooklyn to parents who already                     had six children from earlier marriages. Irving spent much of his childhood alone                     with his mother, who separated from her husband, leaving the older children with him.                     From the age of fifteen Irving began to visit with his father and stepbrothers and                     sisters, with whom he became quite close. He graduated from high school and worked                     at various odd jobs, while becoming deeply involved in radical politics. He soon joined                     the Young Communist League. When he volunteered for service with the International                     Brigades in Spain he reportedly dissuaded one of his brothers from doing the same,                     arguing that it was necessary to stay at home and work to help support the family.                     Irving sailed from New York, according to his sister Betty's account, on February                     23, 1938 and was killed in an ambush at Gandesa in July 1938. - Biography courtesy Tamiment Library, NYU.

Walter Garland                 ----      http://www.alba-valb.org/volunteers/walter-benjamin-garland
Walter Benjamin Garland was born in New York on November 27, 1913. At the age of eighteen he joined the U. S. Army and served for two years attaining the rank of Private First Class. Discharged he returned to New York where he studied mathematics at Brooklyn College for three years. From 1934-1936, he worked as an arranger and copying in the Orchestration Department of NBC on the Lucky Strike Radio Show. Garland joined the Communist Party in 1935 and was active in the National Negro Congress. An early volunteer for the International Brigades, he sailed for France aboard the Champlain on January 5, 1937. Because of his previous military experience, Garland was appointed Section Commander in the 17th International Column. Garland was wounded on February 27, 1937 during the battle of Jarama. Once recovered, Garland was selected to attend Officer Training School and then placed in command of a machine-gun company in the newly formed Washington Battalion. After he recovered from another wound, received during the Brunete campaign, Garland took command of the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion. In August 1937 Garland joined Langston Hughes and Harry Haywood in a radio broadcast back to the United States from Madrid. Two months later he was ordered home to tour and help raise funds for the Friends of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, the American Medical Bureau and other organizations. He also traveled to Washington, D.C. in 1938 to lobby the State Department to lift the embargo on Spain. Garland worked in the Communist Party's Workers Book Shop in New York. In 1938 he ran as the Communist Party candidate for representative of the Sixth Congressional District of New York. Garland was also Communist Party candidate for the New York State Assembly from the 17th Assembly District, Kings County, Brooklyn, in 1940. In 1941 the FBI classified Garland among "individuals believed to be the most dangerous and who in all probability should be interned in event of war." Garland reenlisted in the U.S. Army in World War II. In 1942 he was assigned to the 731st Military Police Battalion stationed at Fort Wadsworth, on Staten Island. There he was invited to give a presentation to a class of officers on the Brunete campaign. Garland taught mapmaking and scout car classes, mortar school, and machine-gun training. He also developed a new machine-gun sighting device for use on guns mounted on scout cars. Garland rose to the rank of First Sergeant but, despite repeated requests, was never allowed to go overseas. After the war Garland, along with fellow Spanish Civil War veteran, Bert Jackson, was instrumental in forming the United Negro Allied Veterans Association (UNAVA). He remained active in the Communist Party's Ben Davis Club in Harlem and worked as a national organizer for the International Workers Order. He also traveled with Paul Robeson in 1949, probably as a bodyguard. According to Garland's FBI File he was expelled from the Communist Party in 1952 and moved to Columbus, Ohio. He died near there in January 1974. ~ Chris Brooks

Herman Rosenstein was born in 1915, son of a garment worker and the youngest of five children. During the Depression Rosenstein worked as a bookkeeper for the William Morris Agency in New York City. He came into political awareness at a time when the threat of Nazism was making itself felt even in his Jewish neighborhood in the borough of Queens, New York. But when Rosenstein declared that he was going to Spain to join the antifascists in the International Brigades, his mother tried to prevent him from going by taking away his passport. Rosenstein soon procured another one, using his mother’s maiden name, Klein, and sailed for Spain in June 1937. Going by the name Herman “Gabby” Klein throughout his time in Spain, Rosenstein fought at first with the Canadian Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, and later transferred to the Lincoln-Washington Battalion. He saw heavy action, distinguishing himself in battle, and was promoted to sergeant. Rosenstein remained in Spain until the International Brigades were evacuated from the country in the winter of 1938.

Edward Issac Lending           ----      http://www.alba-valb.org/volunteers/edward-issac-lending
Isaac Edward Lending was born March 24, 1912 and raised in the Bronx. His father, who ran a textile trimmings business, was a religious Jew and early member of the Zionist Organization of America. As a young man, Lending switched the order of his first and middle names, and was known thereafter as Edward Isaac Lending.Lending studied journalism and business at City College of New York and New York University, but never completed his degree. In 1935 he joined the Communist Party and in 1937, at 27 years old, he departed for Spain aboard the Ile de France to join the International Brigades in fighting the Spanish Civil War. Over the next 21 months, Lending played a variety of roles in the war. He fought and was wounded in the Battle of Brunete. When he recovered, he was promoted to sergeant and fought in the Battles of Quinto and Belchite. In a break from fighting, Lending edited Brigade newspaper Our Fight and worked with volunteer Robert Steck in the Cultural Commission organizing a theatrical troop to entertain rearguard units. In December 1937, Lending volunteered for anti-aircraft service, joining the German Dimitrov Battery in the air defense of Barcelona.After returning to the U.S. in December 1938, Lending became a member of the Executive Board of the Veterans of the Abraham Brigade (VALB). In 1943, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served in World War II, putting his anti-aircraft experience to use in Belgium and Holland. During Lending's service an Army Service Forces investigation reported on his political activities. The report concluded that Lending was to be barred from attending Officer Candidate School as well as from performing a host of security-related duties. He was, however, granted an honorable discharge in 1946.Lending pursued his political goals through journalism and public speaking, meanwhile making his living in sales and advertising in New York City. He married Jean Strunsky in 1949 and lived in Mexico City between 1950 and 1952. In 1960 he married Florence Davis. Their only child together died of Tay-Sachs Disease at age three.While Lending had been devoted to the Communist Party between 1935 and 1943, his disillusionment with policy dictated by Soviet Party leadership had been growing at least since the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939 to the point where he completely severed ties with the Party in 1943. Around this time Lending also grew critical of the VALB organization for what he perceived to be its rigid political orthodoxy. He gradually distanced himself from VALB and embarked upon what became a lifelong mission to persuade his former Spanish Civil War comrades, among others, to reject the Communist Party line. He gave talks, conducted correspondence with veterans, publicly challenged VALB in its publication, the Volunteer, and wrote numerous articles and letters to editors on the issue.Another effort to which Lending devoted much time and energy was raising awareness of Jewish participation in the Spanish Civil War. Among other activities, he joined an endeavor led by veteran Irving Weissman to secure pension rights for struggling Polish Jewish veterans of the Botwin Company; and he initiated a campaign to commemorate Jewish fighters in Spain.

Jacob Joseph Shafran           ----      http://www.alba-valb.org/volunteers/jacob-joseph-shafran
Jacob Joseph (Jack) Shafran was born on December 25, 1917. His stepfather Philip was a carpenter and his mother Mary was a worker in the garment industry and an active union member. During Shafran's early childhood the family moved from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to Union County, New Jersey, before settling on the Lower East Side of New York City. The young Shafran receive his earliest political education walking picket lines with his mother, and through his Aunt Eva, an Eastern European immigrant with strong ties to the Communist Party. He became a member of the Young Pioneers (a children's Communist Party organization), and advanced through the Young Communist League, before joining the Communist Party in 1933. After attending James Monroe High School, Shafran labored as a sheet metal worker and a carpenter, and was an organizer for the Department Store Employees Union, Local 1250. During a strike, he was arrested, convicted of assault, and sentenced to 60 days on Rikers Island.With the outbreak of war in Spain, Shafran and ten other members of Local 1250 including Harry Fisher, Gerald (Jerry) Cook, and Norman Berkowitz volunteered to join the International Brigades to fight for the Spanish Republic. Shafran departed for Spain on the S.S. Beregaria on July 3, 1937. On his arrival he trained as a new recruit with the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion before transferring to the Abraham Lincoln Battalion. He served in Spain from July 1937 until October 1938 participating in the battles of Quinto, Belchite, Fuentos del Ebro, and the Ebro offensive. He was hospitalized on two occasions, once with typhoid late in 1937 and again in August 1938 after sustaining an injury to his hand while carrying a stretcher in the Sierra Pandols during the International Brigades' final month of combat. With the withdrawal of the International Brigades from Spain, the 21-year-old Shafran returned to New York on the S.S. Paris on December 15, 1938.Financial assistance from the Friends of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade enabled Shafran to have reconstructive surgery on his wounded hand. (The operation was performed by plastic surgeon Dr. Arthur J. Barsky, brother of Edward Barsky who led the 15th International Brigade's medical unit in Spain). For the next year Shafran worked as chauffeur and handyman to the legendary burlesque star Gypsy Rose Lee. In 1941 he enlist in the United States Army, was stationed at Fort Dix, New Jersey and later served in Europe. He was discharged in October 1945 and found work in construction. In 1947, while attending a course at the New School, he met Mary Zunk -- a college graduate from Dearborn, Michigan, -- and soon after the couple wed. They adopted three children and settled on Long Island where Shafran established himself as a contractor. He returned to Spain for the first time in 1986, returned again in 1987 for the 50th anniversary of the creation of the International Brigades, and ten years later for the 60th anniversary. In 2003, the 86-year-old Shafran traveled to the barren hills of the Sierra Pandols in the company of his grandchildren to mark the 65th anniversary of the Lincoln Brigade's final offensive.

Leonard Sloan Torgoff          ----      http://www.alba-valb.org/volunteers/leon-sloan-torgoff
Leonard Sloan Torgoff was born in 1916. While attending Brooklyn College as an English major, Torgoff organized workers and led a successful strike against Feltman's Restaurant and hotdog stands in Coney Island, for whom he worked. When his mother died in January 1934, Torgoff took a leave of absence from school. Making his living as a plumber, he committed himself to becoming a writer and began to practice his craft. After a hitchhiking trip in Canada, Torgoff enrolled in night school at City College back in New York. In the summer of 1934 he left home again, this time traveling cross-country to Arizona, ending up enrolled in college at University of Denver in Colorado for the school year 1934-1935. There he wrote "Moods and Muses," subtitled "a literary column," for the college newspaper, The Clarion, in which he reviewed art, plays, jazz, food, poetry and books, and offered observations on beauty, love and war, among other topics. During this time Torgoff also continued writing poems, essays and short stories. Torgoff grew homesick for New York, however, and returned home after a year in Colorado.
